HÀ NỘI Việt Nam will mark four years of natural forest closure this July a measure to reverse severe deforestationA total 58 localities closed their natural forests from July 2016 following Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúcs order which aimed to halt wood exploitation by State agencies including those certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and offer assistance mechanisms to switch to alternative materialsThe order banned entry to forests without permission and banned logging altogetherMore than 27260 cases of deforestation were reported annually from 2011 to 2015 with some 2640ha of forest destroyed each year
The number reduced by 35 per cent between 2016 and 2018 as the policy was adopted
Legal proceedings were launched in 363 cases in the same periodSome 628000ha of forest were planted including 44000ha of protection forest and 577000ha of production forest
The countrys forest coverage rose to nearly 42 per cent by the end of 2018 according to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development MARDThe Central Highlands for the first time in 45 years witnessed an increase of forest area standing at 25 million hectares in 2018As much as VNĐ332 billion US142 million was allocated in 2017 from the State budget to support localities and cover profit losses of forest owners due to the closure order as well as the expenses of management and protectionThe MARD is developing forest carbon sequestration payments focusing on highly polluted industries a measure set to be filed to the Government by the end of 2020Payments for ecosystem services have been accelerated in the central provinces of Nghệ An Quảng Nam and Hà TĩnhThe Việt Nam Forest Protection and Development Fund also works with the Việt Nam Forest and Delta Program and Green Trường Sơn Program supported by USAID to implement payments in other localities including Thanh Hóa Quảng Ninh and Thừa ThiênHuếMore than VNĐ29 trillion 1241 million of service fees were collected in 2018 71 per cent more than the previous year as 43 per cent of the countrys total forestry area enjoyed the payment in 2019Despite incentives and measures taken to protect forests deforestation especially in the Central Highlands continues an indigenous type of plant found at an altitude of 1500m in Đắk Lắk Province is among the most endangeredOffering high economic values forests have become ideal prey for illegal loggers despite harsh terrainSubarea 1219 in Krông Bông District home of ancient trees has suffered tree massacres for years
In the latest case 19 trees were found chopped into pieces pulled down to a nearby valley to be brought out of the forest this April
All of the trees belonged to the protection forestAlthough the destruction is clear as day loggers seem to disappear into thin air and most cases are closed without culprits being punishedChu Minh Quang deputy head of Krông Bông Forestry Companys Segment 2 who is in charge of the subarea 1219 said to approach the area it usually takes guarding forces two days of walking
Therefore despite regular inspections it is impossible to stop loggers from chopping down precious treesOnly 13 people divided into teams of three to four manage more than 12000ha of the forest Quang said
Each shift lasts two to three days and the loggers take advantage of shift changes to fell treesBùi Quốc Tuấn the companys director said under the impacts of climate change local residents have lost livelihoods and become dependent on the forests natural resources
Many have established gangs of loggers joining hands to demolish the natural habitatUntil now none of loggers have been arrested
The helplessness sets a huge challenge to stop the crime said TuấnLê Văn Long head of Krông Bông District Peoples Committee said to encourage people in Yang Mao Cư Đrăm and Cư Pui communes outside of the forest not to trespass and exploit wood local authorities have implemented assistance programmes to help them start businesses and earn sustainable livelihoodsThe district Peoples Committee has investigated local civil servants and residents who gave loggers tipoffs to escape from law enforcementĐắk Lắk Province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development asked forest managers to strictly handle organisations and individuals involved in illegal logging especially Krông Bông Forestry Company which was unable to protect 19 trees from being felledThe lack of sanctions to monitor migration flows and stop forestry land from being illegally traded creates loopholes for deforestation
Meanwhile benefitsharing mechanisms are not attractive enough to call for private sector participation in protecting and planting forests according to the MARDFrom 2021 to 2030 Việt Nam hopes to sustainably manage forests increase forestry coverage and ensure peoples livelihoods in the face of environmental damage caused by climate change according to a plan signed by Deputy PM Trịnh Đình Dũng in midAprilThe plan focuses on accelerating civic engagement in forest protection and development which hands over forestry areas to local residents especially ethnic minority groups to manage and plant trees
The General Department of Land Administration will work as a monitoring body to instruct and inspect localities organisations and businesses to tighten management over forests

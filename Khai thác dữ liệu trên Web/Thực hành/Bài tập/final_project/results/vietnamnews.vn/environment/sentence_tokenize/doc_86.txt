Nguyễn Hoàng Hiệp Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development talks to the Governments website on the need to develop plans to reduce the negative impacts of drought salinity and land subsidence in the Mekong DeltaWe have defined some natural disasters like major typhoons salinity and land subsidence in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the Mekong Delta which cover 19 provincesSaline intrusion in 2016 was described as the worst in the region in 100 years
In 2016 saline intrusion lasted about two months and only two communes in Bến Tre Province were not affected
Yet this year saline intrusion has already lasted five months and the whole Mekong Delta region has been submerged under the waterFacing such serious natural conditions many people have accepted they have to live with such conditions
Some people have raised the idea that they should find ways to adapt to such natural condition and find ways to adapt to the severe natural disaster by developing nonproject or project structuresOf course for the Mekong Delta region we should divide the region into different subregions to control them
For the problem of land subsidence and saltwater intrusion we need to adopt specific measures for some seven provinces but not Đồng Tháp Province or Hồ Chí Minh City as they have not yet been seriously affectedThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development MARD has submitted to the Government and the National Assembly a plan on how to secure a stable supply of clean water for people living in the Mekong Delta
At present more than 3000 water plants have been built in rural areas
However in the dry season the water from these plants has been slightly contaminated by the intrusion of saline water
To solve this problem the MARD has worked with local authorities to discuss ways to ensure there is sufficient fresh water for the local population
At the same time the MARD and local authorities have worked together to lay some 300 km of water pipe to bring fresh water to the people to use in their daily activities
We think this is a good way to solve the problem of freshwater shortage in the Mekong DeltaFor some 20300 households which are scattered here and there we have also developed a plan to build water tanks to hold water for each household
According to our calculations the cost of building a water tank is roughly VNĐ15 million US640
We hope these plans will help people have fresh water for daily useThat study raised an alarm for us and made us think about it seriously
Yet we should not worry much about it
Whether we want it or not it will still occur and we have to look for ways to limit its negative impactsWe all know that there is still no study on the issue of land subsidence in that region
Im pretty sure that in such a situation the MARD will develop plans to meet the freshwater demand of local people while protecting land from subsistence due to deep well drilling by many households for freshwater usageAccording to plan on June 21 the MARD will discuss with the provinces of Cà Mau and Bạc Liêu provinces on ways to bring fresh water from other provinces to the two provinces so they wont have to dig deep wellsAccording to a plan in the next five years 20212025 some major projects will be launched to supply water to the population in Cà Mau and Bạc Liêu provincesIn the context of climate change in the countrys socioeconomic development plan climate change should be considered an important factorHowever to some people in the development plan we should come up with measures to limit the negative impacts of typhoons and floods
The Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have worked closely together to come up with norms on how to ward off the negative impacts of typhoons or floodsIt is reported that in Việt Nam up to 85 per cent of freshwater is used in agriculture production and rice production consumes up to 75 per cent of the freshwater
Meanwhile water used for households accounts for only between 12 per centViệt Nam is a country which has a potential of 850 billion cubic metres of water
At present we consume 100 billion cubic metres per year
It is projected by 2030 the volume will be 110 billion
However water distribution in Việt Nam varies from region to region a challenge for us in keeping water security for productionAccording to forecasts there will be no major floods in the Mekong Delta
So farmers could start their winterspring crop a bit earlier than in previous years

HÀ NỘI Those who discharge more waste or fail to classify their rubbish could pay higher environmental feesThese are two new parts of the draft amended Law on Environment which has been introduced to the National Assemblys agenda last month and is open for public discussionAt a press briefing about the draft law on Wednesday vice head of Việt Nam Environment Administration under the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Nguyễn Thượng Hiền said that State management over solid waste in Việt Nam was inadequateMinistries and agencies were involved in overseeing the issue resulting in overlaps and a lack of cooperation he said adding that improper solid waste management threatened social order and security
For example some people are very concerned about dumping sites that cause pollution to soil and underground waterHiền said that waste classification at source had not become common in Việt Nam while the country had few policies or mechanisms to promote waste classification consequently more and more waste was produced and discharged into the environment
The current law on environment protection does not have any regulations on the polluterpays principle so it fails to encourage people to reduce reuse recycle and classify the waste at source Hiền saidAccording to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development the polluterpays principle is the principle according to which the polluter should bear the cost of measures to reduce pollution to the extent of either the damage done to society or the exceeding of an acceptable level of pollutionHe said that the drafted amendments to the Law on Environment were expected to solve the shortcomings with a highlight on the polluterpays principle instead of current regulations in which everyone pays the same fee regardless of how much waste they produce and dischargeUnder the draft bill solid waste generated from daily activities should be classified into five groups recyclable solid waste food waste or readily biodegradable organic waste dangerous waste bulky waste and other common wasteIf waste is classified properly at source the amount of waste that needs to be treated would be reduced and payment for waste treatment would fall too Hiền saidThe classified daily waste would be put in special bags sold by local authorities
People pay waste treatment fees through buying such bagsFor recyclable waste people can use their own bags without buying special ones from authoritiesIt was expected that revenue from selling the bags could help cover 3050 per cent of waste treatment costs in urban areas in Việt Nam Hiền saidPhan Tuấn Hùng head of the Legal Affairs Department under the Environment Ministry said that the supervisory role of social political organisations like the Việt Nam Fatherland Front associations of women youth elderly and residential groups should be included in the law to ensure proper waste classification collection transport and treatmentThe right public awareness and actions over the issue are the most important factor in implementing the law effectively Hùng saidAccording to the Việt Nam Environment Administration about 61000 tonnes of solid waste is produced in Việt Nam daily of which 24000 tonnes is from rural areasThe volume of solid waste increased from 28 million tonnes in 2009 to 357 million tonnes in 2015 and continues to increase by about ten per cent yearly

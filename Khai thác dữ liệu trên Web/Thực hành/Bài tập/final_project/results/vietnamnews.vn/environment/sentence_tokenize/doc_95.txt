VĨNH LONG While it is said that land is as precious as gold a 74yearold farmer has decided to leave 20000sqm of land alone to give storks a home to nest and lay eggsLê Văn Chìa a resident from Tân Mỹ Commune in Vĩnh Long Provinces Trà Ôn District has been called crazy for forgoing profit from the land over the past 14 yearsIt was in 2006 when dozens of blackcrowned nightherons appeared in my garden
I thought that they would take a rest and then fly away
However they didnt and the bird population started increasing Chìa recalledAfter seeing flocks of birds settling here we decided to do something to help them stay longer and protect them he said adding that he planted cajeput trees so the birds could nestThe land covered with various kinds of plants turns white when storks and other types of birds Asian Koel land every afternoonHis family has suffered economic losses to provide safe shelter for birds as they had no earnings from the gardenAt first the herons nested on longan trees which reduced the yield of a tree by 2030 per cent
As time went by the number of flocks of storks and other birds that arrived at the garden increased leaving the garden filled with longan trees completely damagedIn the old days when a flock of birds didnt settle here the income from longan and mangosteen trees was enough for the family to make ends meet and their childrens schooling
Because of this flock of birds my family lost hundreds of millions per year just to keep them peaceful he was quoted by Việt Nam Agriculture online newspaperChìa said many people have advised him to catch the birds and sell them to ease his familys hardship but he refused to do soAlthough I am poor I never think of selling them for moneyIn addition to guarding the birds against hunters he also seek food for them as they were his childrenWhenever I have free time in the morning I manage to collect fish and shrimp for food for my family as well as for the birdsChìa said that he understood the birds so well that he knew exactly when each kind of bird would leave and their customsFrom the day Chìa turned his orchard garden into a resettlement for birds his life seemed to get harderHe has to watch day and night because some people would try and sneak in to steal the baby birds or shoot the adultsTo prevent bird poachers Chìa put many traps in the garden using cans of milk or beerWhen the thief steps into a trap there would be a sound that will alert the bird to fly away or Chìa to come helpIf he finds any birds injured by poachers he takes them home and cares for them until they are fully recoveredIn his experience if an intruder enters the garden the birds will immediately call for helpChìa said he hasnt slept well for yearsLê Thị Thời 73 Chìas wife said At night upon listening to the sound of the storks and blackcrowned nightheron he takes a light and goes on patrol regardless of the weather to check for poachersEvery night he sleeps in a tent up near the garden to protect the birds even when she has just been discharged from the hospital Thời saidChìa said he had to face illegal hunters many times but one incident stands outI encountered two thieves on that night
Hearing the birds sound I went out of the tent and saw one man run away
The other man who was clinging to a tree immediately shot at meHe was lucky because it just made a hole in a helmet he was wearing he said adding that without the helmet I might have been injured in the incidentHe hopes to receive financial support to erect a fence to prevent hunters from entering the garden to steal the birdsAccording to Chìa his biggest concern is seeking assistance from relevant agencies to preserve the up to 13000 birds
Of these 4000 are a kind of openbill stork
The stork is listed as rare in the Việt Nam Red BookNow Im healthy and still able to protect the birds but I dont know how long it will lastNow as hes getting old and less active one question haunts his mind who will protect the birds when hes gone

To give the breath of life as without breathing oxygen life is not possible
Are you getting enough
We all depend on our lungs for survival and healthy living
The lungs main role is to bring in air from the atmosphere and extract oxygen and pass it into our bloodstream
From there it circulates to all the organs and tissues of our body
At the same time the blood collects carbon dioxide waste which the lungs push back out during exhalation as they also filter toxins in the blood and metabolise biochemicals
Lungs work hard for usHowever along with economic and social development the air around us has at times become severely polluted
Toxic emissions from factories in and around the city and micro dust from vehicles etc make it harder for our lungs to inhale enough oxygen from the airAir pollution is a wellknown and growing concern in Hà Nội especially pollution due to particulate matter or PM
In Hà Nội the most prevalent pollutant is PM25 of which the main source is traffic
This is a concern for many habitants of Hà Nội and surrounding areas and northern Việt Nam particularly for those with increased risks due to smoking or infections or disease of the lung also post COVIDDuring peaks of air pollution there are now more people complaining about cough or difficult breathing and there are more respiratory tract infections in children
People living with chronic respiratory or cardiac diseases have increased risk to experience an asthma attack cardiac attack or cerebral attackBreathing polluted air is also dangerous during pregnancy possibly leading to premature birth and lower birth weight
Children may have slower development of their lungs and may develop asthma and allergies
Adults may develop chronic bronchitis and also lung cancerAfter the COVID19 pandemic people have an increased awareness of how essential lungs are for a healthy life
As such you might want to know how healthy your lungs areHanoi French Hospital proposes a Respiratory CheckUp which includes a consultation with a lung specialist a CTscan of the thorax a pulmonary function test and related blood tests
The outcome of all these will allow us to help you to take action to prevent your lungs becoming sick or indeed to take action to avoid worsening of a diseaseLow dose CT scan is the latest method of modern spiral CT scan which is very safe as it dramatically minimizes the effects of radiation exposure to patients it involves a radiation exposure dose approximate 1mSvexam equivalent to a classic radiology exam whereas the normal routine chest CT scan involves about 7mSv
This radiation exposure dose is very low even compared to natural background radiation which is about 31 mSv personyearStill low dose CT scan provides excellent diagnostic results
This latest method of CT scan helps to detect pulmopleural lesions and other thorax diseases that are not detected by standard chest Xray such as earlystage cancer pneumonia including viral pneumonia even caused by COVID19 CT scan is used to diagnose COVID19 pneumonia when RTPCR testing for SARSCoV2 has not been done bronchiectasis emphysema mediastinal tumors chest wall tumors etcIt can also be used to follow up known lesions not only helping your doctor compare and evaluate treatment results while minimizing radiation exposure to patients that require multiple control examsThorax lowdose CT scan is safer than normal routine CT scan and gives higher value in diagnosis than standard Xrays
It plays a significant role in screening detection and follow up treatment outcomes especially in the context of coronavirus pneumonia spreading all over the world

But thats exactly the journey two newlyweds made cycling from France to Viêt Nam to raise money for charityWhen they set off from France a little over 12 months ago the world was a very different place than it is todayAs they rode across Europe things began to quickly change as the coronavirus spread on a global scale and they only managed to reach Việt Nam in the nick of timeWe started to hear about COVID19 when we were in Thailand and then it started to get stronger when we cycled through Laos said Thibault 30At the beginning we were worried we couldnt enter at the right time in Việt Nam but we managed to enter maybe two weeks before they closed the border
So we were really lucky if you consider the trip of one yearWe were so happy to be back in Việt Nam on timeGetting into the country was simple but Thibault did notice a change in attitudes from people as they continued their cycle trip from north to southHe added After we left Hà Nội there were more cases coming from the UK and Europe and people within one day completely changed their behaviours towards foreigners and especially travellers on bicycleIn the countryside people started to be very worried about me even if I had a mask
It was very challenging to find a hotel even to stop for foodBut we just asked for help from our community on Facebook Instagram and we were very lucky that a lot of people were willing to welcome us in their hotels or homesAs for Nguyên apart from the adventure of cycling from Europe to Asia she also learned valuable lessons from the experience of meeting different people from different countries
Lessons she hopes she can use in the futureIn countries like Iran even though we were strangers if they met us on the road they would invite us to their houses and invite us to have tea or stay for a meal she saidIn Việt Nam I rarely see things like that but after this trip I realised we need to open up more to peopleThe second thing is I have overcome my own limitations
There were times I thought I wouldnt be able to do it but gradually as I persisted I was able to complete a journey that I didnt think I couldTheir journey raised more than 17000 which will be used to build a school in HCM Citys District 1The project is being completed by Poussières de Vie a nonprofit organisation helping Việt Nams most disadvantaged people through funding and managing a variety of projectsOur goal at the beginning was to raise 1 per kilometre Thibault saidWere very glad that we managed to reach that goal even more
We have roughly gathered 17500 for an NGO
We were very glad because many people participated from all around the world not only the French and Vietnamese but also people from the US Canada Australia even in IranThe fund will be used for a new school of this NGO in HCM City which is in District 12
They plan to welcome more kids in better conditionsThe first year will start in September this year 2020 and the fund will be used to buy all the materials the tables the uniforms and help the NGO run their school in this first year VNS

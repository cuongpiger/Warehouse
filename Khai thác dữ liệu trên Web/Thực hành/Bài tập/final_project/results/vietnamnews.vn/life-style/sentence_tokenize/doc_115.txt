KHÁNH HÒA A large dolphin has paid a rare visit to the shallow waters of Cam Ranh Bay in the coastal province of Khánh HòaAt first swimmers thought it was a shark when they saw its fin and scrambled to get out of the water but when Alma Resort lifeguards confirmed it was a dolphin visitors relaxed and remarked they felt lucky to witness the momentIts not every day you get to swim near a dolphin in crystal clear conditions said Nguyễn Ngọc Tân who filmed the dolphin this week saying the mammal seemed fearless yet friendly as he and his fellow lifeguards approached it via jet skiEstimating it to be 35m long Tân and his colleagues said the mammal appeared weak and may have been slightly injured before coming closer to the shoreline
It later swam back to deeper areasThe lifeguards have spoken with various wildlife conservation and research groups including the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation and Endangered Species to inform them about the sighting
Schools of dolphins were recently sighted a little bit further out in nearby Nha Trangs seas but weve never seen a dolphin this close to the shore before Almas general manager Herbert LaubichlerPichler said
The dolphins may be attracted to calmer waters as a result of less tourism activity in the wake of COVID19 VNS

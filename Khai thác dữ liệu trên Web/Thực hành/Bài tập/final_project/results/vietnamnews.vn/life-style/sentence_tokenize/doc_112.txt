Minh Phương and Ly Ly CaoHÀ NỘI Theres a house in Hà Nộis Hà Đông District that really is a headturnerThe fourstorey villa has been decorated in the style of propaganda messages to hammer home the importance of the fight against the COVID19 pandemic
The work was carried out over a month by graffiti artist Lê Long who asked the homeowner for permission to turn the property into a huge canvas for his workI came up with the idea of painting propaganda pictures while witnessing COVID19 spreading all over the world said LongWhen the house owners who are also my close friends said they wanted to change the exterior of their house I discussed the idea with them to change the outside of the house using the COVID19 prevention topicLong 35 spent a month during social distancing to design and paint this artwork
Even though he had to work alone he overcame all the difficulties such as bad weather or shortages of materialsMy work was completed in 30 days from April 1 to 30 during which Hà Nội was in a social distancing period he saidThe most difficult things I faced were the weather and the shortage of materialsI did this artwork during social distancing so everyone was at home at that time
So there were not many shops open for me to buy materials
I just tried to complete it the best I couldWitnessing the unity of the Government and citizens in the fight against the pandemic Long tried to use many national symbols to spread his messageLong said When starting the work I chose the Earth as the theme
And it took me two days to make up a bigger image related to the idea that Việt Nam united together to fight the virusI thought of a flying a legendary bird of Việt Nam which is the symbol of our country and nation
A birdcage means our country unites as one
And I drew the heart inside to emphasise that Vietnamese will bond with each other to contain COVID19When the social distancing measures were eased and everyone was able to hit the street the public and neighbours nearby were amazed to see this unique houseWhen I completed this work people were really surprised when passing by
They didnt imagine there would be a big painting on the houses wall about COVID 19 like this Long saidPeople thought this work was so unique and sometimes asked me about itĐào Thị Lan a neighbour with a shop opposite the house said I sell Huếstyle beef noodle soup opposite the house and a lot of customers asked about the painting which is full of COVID19 imagesCustomers really like the painting and prefer sitting where they can see the house while theyre eatingThe painting is very beautiful
The work about fighting COVID19 is really cool Lan saidThe graffiti artist sees it as the greatest artwork he has painted in his 15year career
For society what he has done with the art is an effective way to raise awareness about the pandemic which has claimed more than 400000 lives worldwide

The Sweden Alumni Network Vietnam (SANV) and Embassy of Sweden in Hà Nội will co-organise the festival to bring excitement, happiness and endless joy to everyone attending this event.Starting from 3pm, participants will learn to make Swedish-style garlands of flowers, dance around the Maypole, play folk games and eat traditional Swedish food.Apart from the Christmas season, midsummer is one of the oldest and most important holidays in Sweden. Midsummer occurs between June 19 and June 25, which coincides with the summer solstice or the longest day of the year. Given Scandinavia’s long, dark winters, everyone is awaiting the arrival of summer when nature is in full bloom and the sun seems to never set.For the Swedish community, midsummer is normally an occasion of large gatherings with family and friends. On that day, the Swedes make garlands from flowers near their homes, raise the Maypole in an open spot and traditional ring-dances ensue as well as outdoor games that everyone can join.A typical Midsummer Festival menu features pickled herring, boiled potatoes, and strawberry cake for dessert. They also drink cold beers and schnapps while singing drinking songs. Regardless of social status, they will put aside their work to be able to fully enjoy this special holiday.The SANV was established in 2017 by Vietnamese people who have studied, researched and lived in Sweden. The network has organised events related to Vietnamese-Swedish culture, activities to promote sustainable development such as: lean the environment, green-living culture, and other events in cooperation with the Embassy of Sweden in Hà Nội and Việt Nam Sweden Friendship Association. — VNS

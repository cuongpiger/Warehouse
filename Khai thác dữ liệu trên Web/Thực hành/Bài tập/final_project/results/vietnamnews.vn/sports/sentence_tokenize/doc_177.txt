HÀ NỘI Seeing motocross bikes flying over verts and drifting through dusty bends is not what youd expect in Hà NộiThe urban terrain and dense population mean if thrillseekers are looking to burn some rubber theyd be hardpressed to find a suitable venueBut now thanks to a group of passionate offroaders the dream of having a complete offroad track has become a reality for daredevils in the capitalJust 10 kilometres southeast of Hoàn Kiếm Lake theres a threehectare site in Long Biên District where bikers can find themselves cornering through sharp bends jumping over verts and crossing lying trees and dipsWhen building the track Vũ Nguyễn Quang Hòa was keen to perfect even the smallest of detailsI am also a biker and am passionate about this adventure sport so I understand what people need said HòaI have studied many tracks of other countries
I built corners and verts to get a more detailed track than the natural terrain and still ensure the highest level of safetyThose corners and verts will make riders feel like their vehicle is about to overturn but in fact they are still safeFor the 35yearold biker the idea and motivation came from what a city offroader needs mostHe added Firstly the idea to build Sunrise Track comes from the desire to have a race venue for everyone to drive on weekends and satisfy their passion instead of going out on roads which are really far awayI really want to ride a motorbike everywhere on the weekend but therere obstacles such as animals crossing the road and unforeseen risksAnd because this is a risky sport it is easy for riders to get injured
So people who do this sport must be equipped with enough protective gear to ensure safetyProtective shoes chest armour helmets and gloves are the basic requirementsSafety is the most important thing
So to have a track like this is really convenient for everyoneAn offroad track inside the capital is everything that a motocross lover needs
And its not just for bikes as its equipped to be used by 4x4 vehicles as wellSince its opening last month Nguyễn Đức Mạnh doesnt have to go out of the city for motocross anymoreThis track has become a new playground for the 28yearoldI feel very excited because although there are natural terrain and difficult obstacles in the suburbs it is necessary to have a separate and appropriate area to combine them all Mạnh saidFortunately right in Ha Noi there is an area gathering all the elements to make terrain with obstacles like this
This helps the drivers emotions go up and down continuously and thats very interestingThe track also attracts newbies and foreigners who want to spend the weekend finding a new hobbyRomanian Adrian Popescu is one of themHe said I like it
Its fun
This is the first time Ive tried this sport I found out about this track on Facebook last week and decided to give myself a tryI went slowly for the first time I was kind of scared when jumping off the vert so I just went really slowly
Other bikers were amazing I think some of them are professional Im hoping to improve my skill in the futureI think they should expand because they have a lot of room to expand and maybe many more people will come and its free so everyone can join
Thats a big bonusMotocross in Việt Nam is looking good according to Trần Mạnh Hùng president of the Hanoi Offroad ClubOur club was officially established in May 2012
After that the offroad motorcycle division was officially recognised as an extreme sport by the General Department of Sports and Physical TrainingIt is an advantage for us to organise official offroad racing tournaments with the purpose of developing the movement and attracting as many players as possibleThis is a growing sport but it is still very niche because of the high risks and it requires a unique place which is isolated from residential areasWith this new track and motocross clubs becoming more and more professional I believe that in the future this sport will develop further VNS

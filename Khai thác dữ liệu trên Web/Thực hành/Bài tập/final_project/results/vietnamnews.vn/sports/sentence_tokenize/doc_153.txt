FootballHÀ NỘI Its not out of the ordinary for old players to thrive in Vietnamese football and the likes of Đinh Xuân Việt 37 years old of Nam Định and midfielder Lê Tấn Tài 36 years old of Hồng Lĩnh Hà Tĩnh are still solid performersBut playercoaches like 35yearold midfielder Nguyễn Vũ Phong are certainly rareLast season Phong helped Bình Phước reach third place in the VLeague 2 for the first time and this year hes played every match for the club in the National Cup and the secondtier leagueIn their second VLeague 2 match of the season on June 11 Phong had a goalline clearance though he couldnt stop his side falling to a 10 defeat to Bình ĐịnhAt the age of 20 Phong was summoned to the national U23 team for the 2005 Southeast Asian SEA Games despite playing for VLeague 2 side Vinh LongDespite not having the opportunity to play at the tournament Phong was courted by Đồng Tâm Long An defending VLeague 1 champion at that time and Bình Dương soon afterMovinh to Bình Dương in 2006 was a turning point in Phongs careerAs a young player trained by Vĩnh Long I had no choice
I only knew that after the meeting between the leaders of two sides I was transferred to Bình Dương said PhongVital goals When he moved to Bình Dương at the age of 21 Phong received only VNĐ100 million US4350 as a signing on fee
It wasnt much money but according to Phong playing for an ambitious team like Bình Dương was a dream come trueIn eight years in Bình Dương Phong twice won the 2007 and 2008 VLeague 1 title and helped Bình Dương reach the semifinals of the 2009 AFC Cup the best achievement of a Vietnamese club at that timeThanks to his performances Phong was selected for the national team by coach Henrique Calisto and was a key part of the team that won the AFF Cup in 2008The midfielder scored three vital goals in the tournament with a brace in a 32 win over Malaysia in the group stages and the opening goal of a 21 firstleg win in the final against Thailand
In his time as a pro Phong only changed clubs twice moving from Vĩnh Long to join Bình Dương 20062013 and then from Bình Dương to SHB Đà Nẵng 20142017For many players moving from club to club is important as it allows them to sweep their earnings but Phong is different
For me being able to live well with my job is my satisfaction
I dont like to transfer because every time I go to a new club I have to get acquainted from the beginning to adapt to the living environment tactical intentions of the coach and the way of playing of new teammates said PhongAfter retiring at the end of 2017 Phong stayed with Đà Nẵng as an assistant for newlyappointed coach Nguyễn Minh Phương a former teammate in the national teamGrizzled veteranFollowing the end of the 2018 season coach Phương moved to Bình Phước and Phong followed him
Because Bình Phước lacked players Phương convinced Phong to be both an assistant and player to lead the young VLeague 2 squadDue to having a 2018 break it was not tough for Phong to regain his fitness but he soon was back to his old self and won the respect of the younger playersWatching Phong playing in friendly matches to prepare for the 2020 season its hard to imagine he was a 35yearold player
He moved aggressively launching attacks and looking for opportunities to hunt goalsAs the VLeague 2 season is a marathon not a sprint coach Phương is afraid for Phongs health
This year I will use Phong less because the young players are also growing up
Although physical strength is not a big problem for Phong I am afraid of him being injured due to too much effort said PhươngPhong in Vietnamese means wind and while Phong the player may be more of a breeze than a whirlwind on the pitch these days the key thing is hes still blowing

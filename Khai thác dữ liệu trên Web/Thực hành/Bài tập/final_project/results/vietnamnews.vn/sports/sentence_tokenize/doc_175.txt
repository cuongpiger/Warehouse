OSLO Double world 400m hurdles champion Karsten Warholm put aside coronavirusinduced Lego building to smash the world record for the unorthodox 300m hurdles behind closed doors at a nearempty Bislett Stadium on ThursdayAfter Oslos famed Diamond League meet scheduled to be held this week was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic organisers chose to innovate as track and field returned with its first international multidiscipline event dubbed the Impossible GamesAnd home favourite Warholm did not disappoint the Norwegian clocking 3378 seconds in the rarelyrun event pulverising the previous record of 3448sec set by Briton Chris Rawlinson back in 2002In a stadium where cardboard cutouts replaced fans barred entry because of the COVID19 outbreak and sociallydistanced dancers with mannequins added ambiance Warholms feat was all the more impressive as he ran the race soloSetting off in his favoured lane seven the 24yearold went through his normal prerace routine before blasting off keeping his rhythm early on before producing a blistering push for the line
Ive been building a lot of Legos yeah and also Ive been training almost just as much putting in training and trying to become even better said Warholm of his time away from the sport
Of course I missed the crowd and everything but its awesome to be back
Its better to do it alone than to not do it at all
There was more home success as a Norwegian team led by the three Ingebrigtsen brothers triumphed in a 2000 metre race over a strong Kenyan quintet led by Timothy Cheruiyot and Elijah Manangoi world 1500m champions in 2019 and 2017 respectivelyThe Kenyans were running simultaneously via video link from Nairobi where they had to contend not only with the citys 1795m altitude but also wind and rainThe Ingebrigtsens Filip Henrik and Jakob maintained an early lead over the Kenyans the latter two brothers taking up the running from the 1km mark
An important occasion The victory went to Jakob Ingebrigtsen just 19 in an European record of 4min 5001sec that smashed the previous best of 45139 set in 1985 by Britains Steve Cram but remained a way off Moroccan Hicham Guerroujs world best of 44479 set in 1999All three Norwegian brothers finished within the 457 mark while the fastest home for the Kenyan team in terrible conditions was Cheruiyot in 50305
Cheruiyot was our main competitor
Its not easy beating a world champion but we did it
said Jakob Ingebrigtsen welcoming a return to the track
Ive spent so much time doing boring training sessions its the competition that counts the most its fun
Cram now a commentator for the BBC said the Oslo meet had been a special and important occasion because its athletics back at the highest level
Its been slightly different without a normal crowd but the athletes had a platform to do their best and they certainly gave it their all
A mens pole vault competition saw world record holder Armand Duplantis of Sweden up against 2012 Olympic champion Renaud LavillenieThe Frenchman had already jumped from his own back garden off a muchshortened runway and his effort was broadcast in line with his Swedish counterpartsThe pair competed last month by filming themselves at home but Duplantis benefitted from proper track conditions to win clearing 586m at the third attempt
Lavillenie failed on his three efforts at the same distanceDuplantis had a shot at a crowdpleaser of 601m but did not come close
I wanted to jump a little bit higher but I knew I wasnt in the best shape of my life right now
I know Im rusty
said Duplantis
Ive been missing competition for sure and even if its not what we are typically used to its still fun to get back on the track
Im going to sleep well tonight Im not going to complain
It was fun to be out there
Good day at work

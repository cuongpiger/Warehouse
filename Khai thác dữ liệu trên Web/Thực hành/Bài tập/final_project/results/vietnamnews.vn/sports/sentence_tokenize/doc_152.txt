MANCHESTER Manchester City secured the first win of the Premier Leagues restart with a 30 victory over 10man Arsenal at an empty Etihad on Wednesday as the English top flights return was marked by protests against racial injusticeBoth sets of players came together before kickoff to take a knee as had Aston Villa and Sheffield United players in the first match after a 100day stoppage due to coronavirus
Im embarrassed and ashamed of what the white people have done for the black people said City manager Pep Guardiola
We have to do a lot of things for the black people which we have not done so far
Citys victory closes the gap on Liverpool at the top to 22 points and means the Reds cannot secure the title when they face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Sunday Artetas plan undone A minutes silence before kickoff remembered those who had lost their lives to COVID19 including Guardiolas motherBlack Lives Matter was also emblazoned on the back of shirts where the stars names are normally printed as the players took a knee around the centre circleThere was little return to normality once the game did kickoff to the hollow ring of an empty stadium as a torrential downpour added to the difficult conditions for the players
We expected it to be weird said Citys Raheem Sterling
The first 10 minutes it was getting used to the atmosphere and getting the cobwebs off
However City soon found their groove just as Arsenal were disrupted by two early injuriesGunners boss Mikel Arteta had made a bold team selection on his return to the Etihad where he spent threeandahalf years as Guardiolas assistantThe Spaniard left Alexandre Lacazette and club record signing Nicolas Pepe alongside David Luiz on the bench while Mesut Ozil did not even make the squad despite a temporary rule change to allow nine substitutes on the benchGuardiola had voiced his concerns for players welfare over the lack of preparation time to get up to full fitnessBut it was Artetas plan that was undone inside 20 minutes as Granit Xhaka and Pablo Mari hobbled off with Luiz replacing the latter
Everything went wrong from the first minute when Granit got injured said Arteta who was left in no doubt of the work he has ahead to close the gap between his new employers and his oldAs City began to turn the screw only Bernd Leno in the Arsenal goal kept the score down before halftimeHowever Sterling made the breakthrough when Luiz failed to cut out Kevin De Bruynes cross and the England international rifled home his first goal of 2020Five minutes into the secondhalf Arsenals tough task became an impossible one as Luiz pulled down Riyad Mahrez inside the box and was shown a red card
It was not the teams fault it was my fault
The coach is amazing all the players did amazing it was just my fault said Luiz whose contract is due to expire on June 30
I should have taken a different decision in the last two months to try and decide my future as early as possible but I didnt
De Bruyne coolly sent Leno the wrong way from the penalty spot to end the game as a contestThere was one more serious looking injury to come as City defender Eric Garcia was stretchered from the field after being wiped out by his own goalkeeper Ederson leading to 11 minutes of added time
He is conscious that is a good sign but he is going to get an extra test said Guardiola of Garcias conditionCity used the extra time to add a third as substitute Phil Foden sidefooted home after Sergio Aguero struck the postDefeat is another blow for Arsenals hopes of a return to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth eight points off the top four

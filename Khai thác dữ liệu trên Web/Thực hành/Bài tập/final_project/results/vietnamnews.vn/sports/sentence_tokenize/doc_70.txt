In life you cannot accept some things but football has given me a lot and a great passion said the 42yearold former AC Milan great
I feel I have a great responsibility
I know I cannot give up and I have never done in my career
I saw a team tonight that wanted to win we deserved it
Theres a God of football who makes you reap all that youve sown
I am proud of what my lads have done
Now we must continue with this spirit also in the championship to recover the disadvantage

There is disappointment for the lads for the club for the fans said Sarri
At this moment we lack brilliance to make the game dangerous and without that brilliance it becomes more difficult

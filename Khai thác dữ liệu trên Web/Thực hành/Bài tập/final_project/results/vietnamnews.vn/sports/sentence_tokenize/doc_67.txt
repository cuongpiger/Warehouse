FootballMADRID Karim Benzemas volley could well be La Ligas goal of the season and Marco Asensios was his first touch in over a year as Real Madrid stormed past Valencia 30 on ThursdayTwo brilliant strikes helped Madrid to a convincing win at the empty Alfredo di Stefano Stadium where Benzema continued his excellent form with a brace after putting his team in front thanks to another combination with Eden HazardValencia had been the better side in the first half when Rodrigo Moreno hit the post and then had a goal controversially ruled out after referee Jose Sanchez consulted VARYet Madrid found a different gear after the break to carve out an impressive victory that reduces their deficit to two points behind Barcelona who play away at Sevilla on FridayBenzemas stunning second goal that saw him take the ball out of the air with one foot and then volley home with the other was a breathtaking moment that came shortly after a dramatic one for Asensio tooAsensio has not played since June 10 last year after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury but the 24yearold announced his return in style volleying in with his first touch 31 seconds after coming on
Its been many months of hard work and Im very happy to play again and to score he said afterwards
I feel a lot of emotion satisfaction
A lot of work has gone into this
It means a lot to him said coach Zinedine Zidane
Were just happy to see him on the pitch again
But with nine games to go in the title race Benzema appears key particularly as his partnership with the resurgent Hazard continues to flourishThis was his 243rd goal for Real Madrid in all competitions putting him above Ferenc Puskas into fifth in the clubs alltime list
Benzemas goal was truly an amazing Zidane said
The volley the way the ball fell with his left footIm happy for him
In fact he twice looked for Hazard in the first half too keenly the first time on the break when he played back inside with Fede Valverde was free outside himAfter a strong start Madrid faded and Valencia came on strong
They hit the post when Maxi Rodriguezs pass sent Rodrigo clear his shot was diverted by the fingertips of Thibaut CourtoisValencia then thought they had scored as Carlos Solers pass to the back post beat both Maxi and his marker Raphael Varane to find Rodrigo who tapped inBut VAR persuaded Sanchez that Maxis heel was offside and also that the ball had feathered his foot on its way through
Rodrigo opened the palms of his hands in disbeliefBenzema tried to nod down for Hazard when he would have been better going for goal but Madrid had lost their purpose and were grateful for halftimeThey were better in the second half with more control
Kevin Gameiro came on for Valencia and his first touch was a costly one a loose pass to Hazard setting Madrid awayHazard played a onetwo with Luka Modric and pushed the ball across for Benzema to finishAsensio came on in the 74th minute after a hug and a smile with Zidane
His first touch was a glorious one as Ferland Mendy beat Daniel Wass to the line and chipped a pass back to his teammate who punched a superb volley into the net with his left footAn incredible moment could only be surpassed by something special which Benzema delivered
Asensio crossed and Benzema lifted the ball in the air over Hugo Gillamon with his right foot and then with his left banged it into the top cornerValencia were dead and buried and Lee KangIn was sent off after three frustrated hacks on Sergio Ramos
He departed with one minute left

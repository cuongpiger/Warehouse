ĐỒNG NAI — A boy in Long Thành District, the southern province of Đồng Nai, has been widely praised after a clip of him clearing trash from a clogged storm drain on June 16 went viral on social media.The clip extracted from the CCTV of a local household showed that Phạm Trọng Đạt, a sixth grader of Long An Secondary School, walked with his bicycle under the rain after school on June 16.Seeing rubbish clogging a street drain, Đạt stopped to remove the trash with his own hands so that rain water could be drained, preventing possible flooding on the street.When Đạt was asked why he did it, he said he thought it was normal and it seemed like the right thing to do.Đạt’s action has impressed online viewers, particularly when localities across Việt Nam have entered the rainy season. Heavy rains usually cause flooding along roads and streets, causing travel chaos.After receiving compliments online, on Monday morning, Đạt was honoured during his school’s flag salutation in front of students, teachers and staff of the school.Leaders of Long Thành District People’s Committee also visited the school to award him with money and certificates of appreciation.Other agencies such as the district’s Education and Training Department, the district’s youth association, and Long An Commune People’s Committee also awarded the boy for his act.Phan Thị Ngọc Mai, principle of Long An Secondary School, said that Đạt and his grandmother were present at the ceremony.Đạt said that he would continue do helpful actions for the community. — VNS

 A zero-đồng supermarket was opened on Saturday to support 1,500 workers of the Thăng Long Industrial Zone in Hà Nội who have been financially affected by the coronavirus pandemic.The shop, lasting for two days over the weekend, is a joint-initiative between the New Zealand Embassy in Việt Nam, the Việt Nam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) and the International Labour Organisation in Việt Nam (ILO).Each customer who visits the zero-đồng supermarket, operated by the Trade Union of Thăng Long Industrial Zone, is allowed to choose a package of groceries worth around VNĐ200,000 for free. Items on the shelf included essential goods such as rice, eggs, cereals, vegetables, noodles, and protective products like face masks, and hand sanitiser.This initiative, funded by the New Zealand embassy, aims to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 among 1,500 workers in the Đông Anh area of Hà Nội, whose jobs and incomes have been adversely impacted by COVID-19.“This project demonstrates the strong partnership between New Zealand and Việt Nam,” said Ambassador Wendy Matthews at the opening ceremony.“This project is a practical initiative to help ease the economic impacts of COVID-19 on Thăng Long workers and their families."New Zealand and Việt Nam celebrate 45 years of diplomatic relations this year. Over that time New Zealand has worked closely with Việt Nam to develop shared prosperity and stability, drawing on the best of New Zealand’s knowledge and skills. — VNS

QUẢNG NAM — The central province of Quảng Nam and the Lộc Trời Group have launched the use of drones in agriculture production – the first step in boosting hi-tech farming and joining the global farm produce supply chain in the near future.The project is part of a series of demonstrations on the use of drones in rice farming in the central region, with the aim of creating a sustainable agriculture system in central provinces of Khánh Hòa, Bình Định, Quảng Nam and Quảng Trị.The programme, which was debuted by the Lộc Trời Group in 2019, plans to build a chain of 100 co-operatives, with close linkages of enterprises and farmers.A report from the group showed that a drone could help spray fertiliser and pesticide on 25ha of crops per day, saving production costs of VNĐ200,000 (US$8.7) to VNĐ300,000 ($13) per hectare.The group said at least 200 drones would be used in rice production in the four provinces in 2020.It’s also the first ever project to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in agriculture production in central Việt Nam.Quảng Nam Province began its first organic rice farm zone on 150ha in Điện Bàn town in 2017.— VNSHÀ NỘI — Environmental pollution, waste and temporary houses at construction sites are risk factors for a dengue outbreak in Hà Nội, said Nguyễn Khắc Hiền, director of Hà Nội Department of Health.Rain and hot weather from June to August create favourable conditions for mosquitoes to develop and could spread on a large scale if prevention and control measures are not put in place, he said.Since the beginning of the year, the capital city has recorded 247 cases of dengue and no deaths.The number of infected cases decreased by 56 per cent compared to the same period in 2019.In Phúc Thọ District, 89 people in eight communes caught the disease, 81 of which were from Tam Hiệp Commune.The Department of Health has requested localities to take measures to combat dengue fever, such as cleaning and killing larvae, especially in high-risk areas.The department also asked local authorities to pay more attention in fighting the disease along with raising awareness and calling on the participation of people and organisations.Training courses to improve skills for supervisory teams and the inspection of prevention and control work should be enhanced to promptly handle places where epidemics have occurred. — VNSCẦN THƠ — The Mekong Delta city of Cần Thơ will issue more preferential policies for investors to set up private nurseries in the city’s industrial parks and processing export zones, according to the city People’s Committee.Speaking at a recent conference on the national project on nurseries at industrial parks and processing export zones, Võ Thị Hồng Ánh, the committee’s vice chairwoman and head of the Steering Board of the project in Cần Thơ, said that female workers with children ageing 6 months and above have to send their children to nurseries and kindergartens when they resume working after six months of maternity leave.The nurseries and kindergartens must have professionally trained staff and facilities that ensure safety for children, Ánh said.Agencies in the city should offer more solutions to attract private investment in safe nurseries and kindergartens to meet female workers’ demands, she added.Notingthat the city plans to establish Singapore Industrial Park in Thốt Nốt District, she said the district should set up health facilities and nurseries or kindergartens to create conditions for workers’ children to be taken care of. This will also attract workers to the IP.She instructed the city Department of Education and Training to provide more preferential policies to attract private investment to build nurseries in IPs and processing export zones.The city could give investors priority in tariff exemptions and reductions, assistance for loans, and land lease, she said.Cần Thơ has four industrial parks and processing export zones with 5,176 workers with children under 36 months old.The total number of kindergartens in the industrial parks and processing export zones is 10. Six out of the ten meet national standards. There are 29 nurseries. The total number of children taken care of at the kindergartens and nurseries is 3,929.Under the national project which started in 2014, teachers at kindergartens and nurseries are professionally trained further by the Department of Education and Training. The other staff in charge of taking care of children also participate in courses on food safety and hygiene.All private nurseries have been issued a certificate for injury prevention and safe schools.  Local authorities and relevant agencies check the nurseries frequently. Inspections have shown that their classrooms and toilets for children are clean. Investors have spent VNĐ519 million (US$22,285) on upgrading their nurseries’ facilities.The Hậu Giang Pharmaceutical Joint Stock Company has built a kindergarten, while the Nam Hải Food Import Export Co. Ltd has used 2,000 square metres to build Hoa Hồng Kindergarten to serve its workers' children.The Department of Education and Training has suggested that the city People’s Council provide assistance of more than VNĐ1.2 billion ($51,517) to buy teaching aids and toys for children.The conference’s delegates said the project had helped workers feel more secure about their children's safety. — VNSHÀ NỘI — The Vietnamese and Japanese governments have agreed to gradually ease travel restrictions between the two countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced.Related measures and procedures will be discussed via diplomatic channels.The ministry said the two governments have worked closely in COVID-19 prevention and control.The Vietnamese Government praised the significant outcomes of Japanese efforts to curb the spread of the disease.

If I lived in Vietnam and my name sounded like Eat a Dick, I would change it to avoid embarrassment both on my part and on the part of the people who had to say it. I understand you are offended, but you need to understand your name is an offensive sound in my language. I repeat my request,” he replied.Laney College, a public community college in Oakland, California, said in a  signed by President Dr Tammeil Gilkerson that the college was “aware of the allegations of racist and xenophobic messages from a faculty member at our college with a student about the pronunciation of their name”.The statement went on to say the college takes the accusations seriously and that the unnamed faculty member, believed to be Hubbard, had been placed on “administrative leave pending an investigation”.The incident caused a vociferous backlash on , with many characterising Hubbard's comments as racist.Hubbard declined to comment for this story. — VNSHÀ NỘI — Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has ordered toll booths nationwide to switch to automated non-stop toll collection no later than December 31 this year.Toll booths will be suspended if they have already installed non-stop system but have not switched to automated collection by the end of this year, he said in a recently-issued decision which will take effect from August 1.In order to pay a toll through the automated system, automobile owners will be granted free e-tags before December 31.Owners will have to pay service fees for e-tags from December 31.The tags are required to be placed on the front window of the automobile, and when the vehicle passes a toll collection lane, a Radio Frequency Identification system installed at the toll station will activate a camera to photograph the vehicle’s plate number while reading the e-tag.The e-tags will be issued by vehicle registration centres or service providers' authorised branches.The Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of National Defence shall co-ordinate with the Ministry of Transport and service providers to issue e-tags for vehicles in the fields of security and defence.Automobile owners can pay the fee directly at the bank, through their bank accounts or choose other types of payment.Depending on the conditions of each toll booth, State agencies are granted authority to maintain one mixed lane, apply for both non-stop and one-stop toll collection and decide the time when one-stop collection will be switched to non-stop.In case automobile owners do not have enough money in their accounts to pay for non-stop collection, they can move to the mixed lane and pay through the one-stop collection system.The service providers will hand over the toll to investors after expenses on non-stop fee collection are cleared. Each handover should not be more than 24 hours apart, except for special negotiations.The investors and service providers have to obey the laws on paying taxes. PM Phúc asked for efficiency, openness and transparency in automated non-stop fee collection at toll booths with payback periods of less than three years.According to the PM’s new decision, the automated non-stop toll collection system must be designed, installed and built in a synchronous manner throughout the country, ensuring rapid, accurate, efficient and safe operation.Investors are allowed to design, invest in construction as well as renovate, maintain the system at toll booths to connect them with data centres of service providers.The investment and maintenance must be approved by State agencies. — VNS

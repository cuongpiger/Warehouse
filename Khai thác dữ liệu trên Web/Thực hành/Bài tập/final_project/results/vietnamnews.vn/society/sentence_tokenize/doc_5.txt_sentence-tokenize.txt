We prioritise ensuring that the messages we send to the public whether it is a hospital patient student parent or school official are consistent and recurring which means that individuals are constantly being reminded of safe road behaviours so that they do not forget how lifesaving a helmet can beSchools are selected based on a variety of vulnerability criteria including proximity to large busy roads with many vehiclesAt target schools in HCM City the preobservation helmetwearing rate of students was just 23 per cent
Following intervention the rate increased to 77 per centIn Thái Nguyên Province they were 27 per cent and 80 per centThrough Safety Delivered 10942 total helmets will be distributed across Việt Nam during the 201920 school year to students teachers parents and their families

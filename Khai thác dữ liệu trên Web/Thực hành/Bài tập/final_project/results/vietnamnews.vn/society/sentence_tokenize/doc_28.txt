Thu VânHÀ NỘI They say one mans trash is another mans treasure and for Trần Quyết Thắng that old proverb couldnt be more accurateOver the past few years the 36yearold has been collecting items people have discarded and breathing new life into them restoring cleaning and fixing old desktop computers laptops and thousands of textbooks to help those less fortunateNow he is on a new mission and he wants bicyclesIn many rural areas in Việt Nam like the area where Im living in poverty and hunger still exist Thắng said
Many students do not have bicycles to go to school and their situations are often difficult their parents might have passed away their grandparents are oldThắng had no clue how to repair bicycles before he began the project and needed to learn from scratchThe idea came to fruition during his many trips with his cycling club in Hương Sơn Commune of central Hà Tĩnh ProvinceWhile on the road he saw the large number of children who couldnt afford their own wheels and instead would walk often long distances to get to schoolMany students have to drop out of school because of their difficulties and low selfesteem because they dont have a bicycle
Ive always wanted to support and share with those in need so I did this to help them he saidBack in April he took to social media to ask for old bicycles and in just two months he was sent 60He spent the next week visiting local repair shops to brush up on his handyman skills knowing in this instance he had to ensure the bicycles not only looked good but would be safe
An incorrectly assembled bicycle can be dangerous so I needed to seek advice from a bicycle shop he saidAfter starting out with next to zeroknowledge of spokes gears pedals and chains Thắng is now a dab hand at bicycle repairsWith quality used bicycles I dont have to spend too much time but with some of the old ones it can take a whole day to fix he saidThe process includes fully disassembling the bike removing the old paint cleaning degreasing paint stripping other components adding new parts if needed fixing the chain brakes and cablesStripping the bicycle can take a long time since corrosion can jam certain things and removing the old paint using an angle grinder can be dangerousIve had countless cuts on my hand and legs when doing the repair work he laughedBut of course Ive never been discouraged my difficulties are nothing compared to those of the students in need he saidAfter his hard work he has turned many a rusty old bicycle into a bright yellow and a very cool new set of wheels for lots of childrenHis attention to detail is second to none
Each bike has smart black letters wheels and spokes are nickelplated and the handlebars and mudguards gleam in the sunFrom trash to treasure but the real precious sight for Thắng is the look on the kids faces when he hands over the bicyclesIts a wonderful feeling that cant be described by words Thắng saidWhen we gave the bikes to the students they were very happy
We all felt that joy and found this work to be more meaningful he saidHe recalled the story of an eightyearold boy who came to his house on foot to ask Thắng if he could get a new bicycleThe little boy heard about Thắngs work and desperately wanted one of his ownHis parents died and he and his older brother stayed with their grandparents who are poor and sick said ThắngHis brother had to drop out of school already and the little boy was intending to quit as wellThắng and his friends gave two bicycles to the boys along with some school supplies with the hope that they would continue their studiesI dont want to be seen as charity and advertise with poor children who dont have chances in life
Instead of just simply handing out free fish I want to give them the rod so they can go out and fish for themselves or in this instance go to school and have better opportunitiesThắngs good deeds have been an inspiration to many othersPhạm Nguyên Soái a young artist in Hà Nội a friend of Thắng is following his leadI had this idea two years ago but havent had the chance to do it yet
When I saw Thắngs post on Facebook Im glad that my idea was finally realised Soái saidSoái is now also receiving old bikes to repair them and give them to children in Hà Nội
Another friend of Thắngs in HCM City is doing the same thingIm glad that several people have contacted me to either offer help with the repair work to donate their used bikes or to set up a similar model in their areas Thắng saidIf every locality can do this the number of bikes given to children in need would be significant and that would really do something to change their future he saidIf you would like to help contact him via his Facebook page

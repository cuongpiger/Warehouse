HÀ NỘI — Hà Nội police on Friday proposed prosecuting 29 people in Đồng Tâm Commune, Hà Nội’s Mỹ Đức District for involvement in the deaths of three police officers in January.The police have handed over investigation results of the fatal confrontation in which a group of villagers clashed with soldiers building a wall at Miếu Môn military airport.Twenty-nine Đồng Tâm villagers who allegedly discussed, set up the plan and attacked officers on duty included Lê Đình Công, Lê Đình Uy, Bùi Văn Niên, Nguyễn Văn Tuyến, Trần Thị La, Bùi Thị Nối, Bùi Văn Tiến, Nguyễn Thị Lụa, Bùi Viết Hiểu, Bùi Văn Tuấn, Nguyễn Quốc Tiến and Lê Đình Doanh.According to the investigation, the defendants poured gasoline into a pit and lit it on fire, resulting in the deaths of three police officers. The violent actions aimed to kill many people and need to be stiffly punished to ensure the law’s strictness, according to police.Lê Đình Kình, the alleged mastermind leading the villagers, reportedly distorted the origin of the land in Đồng Sênh Area, incited and enticed villagers to participate in filing complaints and killing police officers.Kình died in the incident so the investigation agency did not mention any punishment imposed on him.The investigation reported that while the Air Defence-Air Force under Ministry of National Defence built a fence to protect Miếu Môn Airport, police who were ensuring security and order were attacked at Hoành Hamlet’s gate by villagers using grenades, petrol bombs and bricks.Although the Hà Nội Inspectorate concluded the land lot is used for defence purpose, Lê Đình Kình still reportedly promised to divide the land lot to villagers who filed the complaints.In early December 2019, Kình allegedly gave VNĐ500,000 (US$22) to Lê Đình Doanh to buy 10 pig-slaughtering knives.Doanh is then believed to have made iron pipes to attach to the knives.At meetings on three days between January 6 and 8, Kình allegedly gave the order to kill three soldiers and police officers to chase away officers on duty. — VNS

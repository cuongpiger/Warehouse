US$21,500).The fisheries society condemned the “inhumane act” that threatened the lives and livelihood of Vietnamese fishermen as they fish in Việt Nam’s rightful waters.The organisation asked the Vietnamese authorities to voice its protests with China, asking them to stop all attacks against Vietnamese fishermen and demand compensation.They have also asked to increase patrols to provide support and protection for Vietnamese fishermen. — VNS

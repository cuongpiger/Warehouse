NEW YORK — Việt Nam and Indonesia delivered a joint speech supporting efforts by the government of Haiti in constitutional reform and called on parties in Haiti to enhance dialogues during a video conference of the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Friday.The meeting looked into the situation in Haiti and the report of the UN Secretary-General on the operation of the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH).Both Việt Nam and Indonesia expressed concern over difficulties and uncertainties regarding the situation in Haiti, especially the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.They said they back the electoral process and the intensification of women’s participation.The two countries also lauded the BINUH for its measures in support of Haiti and urged the office and the UN working group to identify concrete measures to help Haiti deal with pressing issues.Other UNSC member countries praised the office’s supporting role in the political transformation and stressed the need for Haiti to step up political dialogues and constitutional reform.They voiced concern over armed criminal gangs and appealed to the international community to continue their support to Haiti in handling these challenges.Helen La Lime, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of the BINUH, said the situation in Haiti calmed down recently and some political parties called on people to join efforts to combat the pandemic.Haiti had confirmed 4,900 COVID-19 cases so far, with 84 deaths, she said, adding that Haiti’s economy was expected to contract 4 per cent this year while inflation would expand 20 per cent.The office assisted the Haiti government in political governance, community violence reduction, justice and rule of law, human rights, unemployment, youth and other vulnerable groups, basic social service delivery and resilience, she said.Established on June 25, 2019, the BINUH works primarily with state institutions to strengthen political stability and good governance, including the rule of law, advancing a peaceful and stable environment, including through supporting an inclusive inter-Haitian national dialogue and protecting and promoting human rights.The activities of the mission that aim to create sustainable development are integrated with those of the 19 agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations Country Team, which deliver humanitarian assistance and development programmes led by national authorities. — VNS

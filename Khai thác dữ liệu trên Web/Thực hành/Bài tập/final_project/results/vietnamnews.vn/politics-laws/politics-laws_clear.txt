HÀ NỘI — Deputy Minister of National Defence Sen Lt Gen Nguyễn Chí Vịnh, on Tuesday, engaged in two online talks with Jody Thomas, Deputy Minister of Canada’s Department of National Defence, and Peter Tesch, Deputy Secretary for Strategic Policy & Intelligence at Australia’s Department of Defence.Canadian and Australian ambassadors and military attaches to Việt Nam also took part in the talks.During the talks, Vịnh informed the Australian and Canadian officials on the COVID-19 situation in Việt Nam, attributing the good outcomes in controlling the disease to concerted efforts of the entire political system, with the Việt Nam People’s Army serving as the core and vanguard force.Highlighting the importance of international collaboration in the fight against the pandemic, he thanked Australian and Canadian defence bodies’ co-operation in sharing information on COVID-19 prevention, control, research and treatment. He hoped the joint work will last for long given the COVID-19 complexities.On the occasion, Vịnh and his counterparts reviewed outcomes of Việt Nam – Australia and Việt Nam – Canada defence ties in the past and sought agreement on future orientations with a stress on military medical coordination in disease prevention and control. All sides vowed that they will not allow the pandemic to hinder their thriving co-operation.The Vietnamese and Canadian officials expressed their delight at breakthroughs in the relations of the sides after their defence ministers exchanged visits, particularly in human resources training and UN peacekeeping missions.The Canadian side said it plans to set up a military attaché office in Việt Nam this year, and the two sides agreed to push for the establishment of a bilateral defence policy dialogue mechanism toward building a 3-year co-operation scheme for the two defence ministries.Meanwhile, Việt Nam and Australia took note of outstanding joint work, such as Australian military aircraft, for the second time, transporting personnel of Việt Nam’s level-2 field hospital to South Sudan for a peacekeeping mission. The sides also began teaming up to organise activities searching for Vietnamese soldiers missing during wartime, shooting skills exchanges; and discussions on women, peace and security.Vịnh stated Việt Nam’s Ministry of National Defence is committed to the effective implementation of defence co-operation with Australia and Canada based on signed documents and agreements for the benefit of the sides involved and of the region.The official also informed his counterparts on the schedule of activities during the year Việt Nam serves as Chair of ASEAN (2020) and its tenure as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council (2020-21).He highlighted Việt Nam’s determination in strengthening collaboration within the framework of the ASEAN Defence Minister’s Meeting (ADMM) and ADMM Plus.He stressed Việt Nam backs Canada’s responsible participation in the region in line with ASEAN’s consensus principle and praised Australia’s success in hosting the first informal ASEAN – Australia defence ministers’ meeting. — VNSHÀ NỘI — The National Assembly on Thursday passed a law amending and supplementing the Law on the Issuance of Legal Documents with 449 out of 457 lawmakers voting in favour.Notably, the NA ruled People’s Councils and People’s Committees at the district and communal level can issue legal documents.Lê Thị Nga, chairwoman of the NA Judicial Affairs Committee, said the regulation would empower local administrations to make decisions on issues relevant to the socio-economic conditions of their locality.The new law stipulates that legal documents can only be revised, supplemented, replaced or revoked by other legal documents of the State agencies which issued the old documents.The documents announcing the revocation of legal documents must be published in public newspapers.In the morning session, lawmakers also looked into the draft law amending and supplementing the Law on Handling Administrative Violations.While most deputies agreed on the enforcement of the law, they proposed the fine be raised to the maximum to deter violations.Many deputies said administrative violations must be handled accordingly and that it was necessary to improve the related legal framework to ensure the rights of the people.Deputy Lê Công Định from the northern province of Long An called for additional measures including community service or naming violating individuals and units.Deputy Nguyễn Thị Mai Hoa from Đồng Tháp Province agreed that community service should be applied.She said this kind of punishment would leave a direct impact on violators as well as on the community’s awareness. In some cases, administrative punishment was not effective as well-off violators could easily pay the fine, Hoa said.Phan Thị Bình Thuận, a deputy from HCM City, said administrative punishment should be reviewed to ensure it was strong enough.He emphasised that although administrative punishment was common, a penalty which was too low might not be a deterrent.Many deputies voiced concerns over halting water and electricity supply to a unit as a punishment, saying it may lead to serious consequences.Deputy Nguyễn Văn Hiển from Lâm Đồng Province said cutting off electricity and water might damage the property of violaters and innocents alike, which is beyond the enforcement requirement for handling administrative violations.He suggested such a sanction should only be used for dealing with violations in construction, recreation services and producing or trading of contraband or banned goods.According to deputy Nguyễn Sỹ Cương from Ninh Thuận Province, cutting off electricity and water was inhumane because there would be innocent victims.“It is unwise to cutting off electricity when the weather is 40 degrees Celsius,” he said, adding that the measure should be applied to construction, not to production and trading units. — VNSHÀ NỘI — Legislators voted to pass a law amending and supplementing some articles of the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and the Law on Dykes at the ongoing ninth session of the 14th National Assembly (NA) in Hà Nội on Wednesday.With 92.34 per cent of votes in favour, deputies agreed to review and adjust the laws.The law supplements provisions for prioritising allocation of resources for research, development and implementation of science and technology programmes in natural disaster prevention and control.It also strengthens solutions to overcome consequences of natural disasters, giving priority to training and capacity building training for people working in natural disaster prevention and combatting; providing equipment for natural disaster prevention and fighting at commune-level.Regarding the Law on Dykes, the new law prohibits construction of houses within the dyke protection area and the area of riverbed except for works to serve flood and storm prevention and combating. The dumping of waste and exploitation of soil and gravel within the dyke protection scope, river banks as well as other activities obstructing flow and flood drainage were also banned.The law added forest fires starting from natural causes as a type of natural disaster. It also clearly stipulates the authorisation as well as the allocation of relief resources. The regulations on international co-operation were also defined.Earlier while delivering a report on the law at the NA Standing Committee, Chairman of the Committee of Science, Technology and Environment Phan Xuân Dũng said forest fires originate from natural and man-made causes. The prevention and fight against forest fires have been already stipulated in the forestry law and fire prevention regulation.However, due to adverse effects of weather, the risk of large forest fires was high, occurring on a large scale and simultaneously in many provinces and cities.Such regulations do not overlap with the Law on Forestry, the Law on Fire Protection, and overcome the limitations of current regulations when the risk of forest fires is widespread and serious.The law will take effect from July 1, 2021.The NA also debated the draft law on international agreements on Wednesday.Most NA deputies agreed on the need to enforce the law on international agreements to perfect the legal foundation, contributing to institutionalising the Party’s policies and guidelines on international integration towards higher quality and efficiency. It also dealt with shortcomings of the 2007 ordinance on signing and implementation of international agreements.However, many deputies were still concerned over giving authority of signing international agreements to People’s Committees at district and commune levels, said Nguyễn Văn Giàu, head of NA’s External Commission.There are always hidden sensitive issues in politics, foreign affairs, national defence and security in international co-operation which required signatories to have a certain capacity, he said, adding that not all agencies and organisations can sign international agreements.Deputy Trần Văn Mão from Nghe An Province and Deputy Nguyễn Thanh Xuân from Cần Thơ City proposed the compiling committee review the feasibility of agreements as district and communal authorities have limited capacity.Some deputies also worried about the possibility that disputes might occur and how to handle them after signing international agreements.Việt Nam currently has about 11,000 communes, with more than 600 districts. The expanding of signing international agreements to commune level was too large, they said.Trương Trọng Nghĩa, from HCM City, suggested only certain agencies at provincial level be given signing authority.The provincial committees would sign the agreements instead of the district or communal level regarding to the signatory of international agreements to limit the risk of petitions, he said.Deputies also passed a draft law amending and supplementing articles of the Construction Law.Lawmakers agreed to reform the administrative procedures for granting construction permits, especially separate housing works in rural areas.Legislators also suggested tightening the management of construction order, which is directly linked to granting construction permits.They said construction order management is not only associated with the construction law but also related to the land law, planning, the handling of administrative violations, and the organisation of local governments.Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of People’s Committees at the district and provincial levels, according to lawmakers. VNSNguyễn Đức Lợi, General Director of the Vietnam News Agency, speaks about the agency's transition process on the occasion of the 95th anniversary of Vietnamese Revolutionary Press Day (June 21).Developing multimedia and multi-platform journalism is a common trend in the world today. The Vietnam News Agency has taken concrete steps in recent years, and in fact has become a multimedia agency, developing all types: print, radio, television, online newspaper and books. With all kinds of information on modern technical platforms, the Vietnam News Agency constantly strengthens the position of a news agency to provide original/source information to domestic and international press agencies and provides information directly to the public.a television centre and a database-documentation and infographic centre and eight editorial offices including Tin Tuc (The News) newspaper, VietnamPlus e-newspaper, The thao & Van hoa (Sports & Culture) newspaper, Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Region Pictorial, Vietnam Pictorial, Viet Nam News, Le Courier du Vietnam, and Vietnam Law & Legal Forum), along with five news support centres, a publishing house, two printing companies, the VNA representative office in the south, the VNA representative office in the central – Central Highlands region; and functional units to support the VNA General Director.With representative offices in all 63 cities and provinces nationwide and 30 overseas bureaus across the five continents, the VNA has a strong contingent of reporters working across the country and in most of the key areas around the world. This is a unique advantage that no other press agency in Việt Nam has.The launch of VietnamPlus online newspaper in 2008 and the official broadcast of Vietnam News Channel (Vnews) in 2010 were steps towards the aforementioned target, reflecting the vision of the Vietnam News Agency Board at that time. Later, to adapt to changes in information needs, in 2017, Vietnam News Agency established the Database-Documentation and Infographic Centre, which provides a wide range of materials systematically summarised from official sources regarding major current events at home and abroad on the portal vnanet.vn, and produces a number of TV shows. On September 15, 2015, VNA brought VNA's information and news to social networks, starting with promoting Vietnamese information, then developing in other languages such as English, French, Chinese and Spanish.In March 2012 I had a business trip to Japan. This trip left a strong impression on me about the quick adaptation of a news agency in the context of constantly developing digital media, in which I paid special attention to the information centre in the convergence model of Kyodo News. In my following business trips in many other countries, such as China, South Korea and Russia or when attending the annual conference of the Asia-Pacific News Agency (OANA), I witnessed the dramatic transformation of leading regional news agencies, such as Xinhua News Agency, Yonhap, and TASS. These companies are fast-paced with the advances of modern communication technology, they use robots as television programme instructors, apply artificial intelligence to produce sports news, develop cloud computing to transmit information directly. From such experience, we are more determined to speed up and concretise the steps to bring Vietnam News Agency to become the nation's primary multimedia agency.Vietnam News Agency is well prepared to catch the trend of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and we have many products of this revolution. VietnamPlus Chatbot application is an example. Along with that, there are data journal products using Big Data and Voice to Text system. As for how much we invest in information products, it depends on each stage of the development of communication technology and the ever-changing needs of the audience.With agility and focus on investment, up to now, Vietnam News Agency has had many newspapers and websites successfully applying modern technologies for the production of press products like VietnamPlus,  newspaper,  (Sport and Culture) newspaper and Vnews. We have mega stories, Rap News, live, podcasts, infographics, timelines, 360 photos, Audio. The creativity and investment in professionals, as well as technology, is well received and appreciated by readers.In addition, in recent years, Vnews has created a breakthrough in the application of new technologies and techniques for production to ensure stable round the clock broadcasting. At the end of 2019, Vnews invested in a new modern newsroom system, deploying the 10Gb network infrastructure system. At the same time, it successfully built an information storage system and put into operation the MAM online TV operating system, which is a professional working support system that ensures transparent workflow, quick and accurate information.The project 'Developing Vietnam News Agency into a major multimedia agency of the national media system' is a name that we have considered both on a legal and practical basis. In the era of digital media thriving under the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, along with the increasing and diverse requirements from the public, the Vietnam News Agency‘s development in the model of multimedia, on the basis of multi-platform to promote the strengths of various types of journalism is an inevitable trend.Regarding solutions, I think every solution must ensure effective implementation of the following specific functions and tasks:- VNA is the only Vietnamese news agency that provides information for the domestic and foreign press system.- VNA is the only press agency to provide reference information on the situation in the country and the world, serving the leadership of the Party and the Government, research and policymaking agencies.- The Vietnam News Agency is the only press agency tasked by the Secretariat to publish press publications in the languages ​​of all ethnic minority groups in Vietnam.- The Vietnam News Agency is the only press agency tasked with announcing the official opinion of the State on topical issues, adjusting information that is not in line with national interests when it is necessary to issue a statement to reject information that is intentionally misrepresented.- VNA is the national key foreign information agency.- VNA is the only press agency with a network of permanent correspondents spread across 63 provinces and cities and is also the press agency with the most resident agencies abroad (30).- VNA manages the largest national image archive in Việt Nam.To always perform well the above functions and tasks, the human factor is decisive. Therefore, the development of the Vietnam News Agency's human resources must ensure a sufficient quantity and attach importance to improving the quality through strengthening training and retraining so that the Vietnam News Agency journalists have enough political quality and modern journalism capacity. --VNSHÀ NỘI — The promulgation of the Việt Nam Border Guard Law is very necessary and would recognise the legal status of the border guard force in the country, a National Assembly (NA) deputy has said.Deputy Dương Minh Tuấn made the statement at the NA morning session to discuss the draft law on Tuesday.Tuấn said border soldiers had contributed greatly to maintaining security and social order as well as protecting the nation’s land and sea borders for years.When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country, the border soldiers also helped fight the pandemic, he said.Tuấn added that the lawmaking process was carefully consulted with relevant parties and it was necessary to promulgate the law now.Contributing his comments on the draft law, NA deputy Lưu Thành Công said he applauded the compilation of the law, which looks set to replace the Border Guard Ordinance issued in 1997.Công added that the draft law needed to supplement regulations on protecting national border markers and the borderline.NA deputy Nguyễn Thị Xuân said the draft law should supplement regulations on prohibited acts of destroying border makers, as the border was very important and the national border markers showed national sovereignty.Deputy Vũ Xuân Cường said he wanted the law to be adopted soon and to later set up a specialised force to better protect the border.Also at the session, NA deputy Phạm Tất Thắng recommended reviewing the name of the law, as the current name would mandate adding contents regarding "building national borders" and "functions and tasks of law-enforcement forces at the border”.Thắng said the name of the law should be reconsidered in line with other current laws, including the Law on People’s Public Security and the Law on Việt Nam Coast Guard, to avoid overlaps between legal documents.Concluding the discussion, Vice Chairman of the National Assembly Đỗ Bá Tỵ said the name was suitable and consistent with Resolution No 33 of the Politburo on the National Border Protection Strategy and the Programme on Law and Ordinance Compilation, decided by the NA. — VNSNEW YORK — Ambassador Đặng Đình Quý, head of the Vietnam Mission to the United Nations, has shared the concern of UNSC members over security and terrorism challenges in Syria and called for more humanitarian support for the country.During a monthly teleconference on Syria situation held by the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Tuesday, Quý urged parties concerned to respond to the ceasefire appeal by the UN Secretary General and his Special Envoy.The Vietnamese ambassador also called on parties to maintain security stability in order to facilitate talks to seek political solutions to Syria’s issues.He expressed concern over socio-economic difficulties, the serious humanitarian crisis and COVID-19 impacts faced by Syrian people.Speaking at the event, Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Syria Geir Pedersen said up to 80 per cent of Syrian people are living below the poverty line and 9.3 million people lack food. Environment and infrastructure in the African country have been also seriously hurt after nearly a decade of conflict.He reiterated the national ceasefire appeal to facilitate the search for political solutions in accordance with the UNSC’s Resolution No. 2254, and the settlement of humanitarian issues in face of new challenges arising from COVID-19, with special attention to refugees and those forced to leave their residences.Syria entered the 10th year of instability and conflict, creating one of the most serious humanitarian crises in history with hundreds of thousands of people injured and millions of others losing their homes. — VNSHÀ NỘI — Ninety-five years ago on June 21, 1926, the first issue of  (Youth) newspaper representing the voice of Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League founded by Nguyễn Ái Quốc (aka Ho Chi Minh) was published, marking the birth of Việt Nam’s revolutionary press as the country remained under the yoke of French colonial rule.After , the Vietnamese founding father set up (Workers & Farmers) newspaper in 1926 to spread patriotism to the farmers and workers under the light of scientific socialism,  (Revolution Soldiers) in 1927 to encourage Vietnamese soldiers in the French colonial armies to stand up against the oppressor of their own people and  (Hammer & Sickle) newspaper – the mouthpiece of the Indochinese Communist Party – in 1929, among others.Despite the arrests of Vietnamese patriots, successive newspapers and magazines were put into circulation from within the cells of the colonial regime, including (Hoả Lò Prison Hà Nội),  (The Red Inmate),  (Guiding Torch),  (Buôn Ma Thuột Prison) and  (Jail magazine), in addition to many newspapers from student organisations and communist cells across the country.According to the General Government of Indochina, by June 1936, there were some 230 newspaper, magazines and journals of all types circulating in Việt Nam.Since the birth of , the Vietnamese revolutionary press has upheld the revolutionary banner, conveyed the will and aspirations of the nation and guided the Vietnamese in the fight for independence, freedom and pursuit of socialism.In the following years, the revolutionary press incorporated political struggle with armed struggle, contributing to the building of armed forces towards the general uprising to seize back power for Vietnamese in August 1945.During the resistance war against the French colonialists attempting to regain control over Indochina, after 1945, newspapers and magazines were born one after another to serve Party building, dissemination of Marxism-Leninism ideology and the Communist Party of Việt Nam's civil rights revolution, inspiring resolution against imperialism and feudalism and preparing to take the opportunity to elevate the revolution to a new height.Some exemplary newspapers and news agencies, radio in this period include  (National Salvation),  (The People),  (Vietnam News Agency),  (Liberation News Agency, later merged into VNA),  (People's Army),  (Communist Review),  (Arts),  (Vanguard),  (Labour) and  (Voice of Vietnam), many of which are prominent press agencies in the country to this day.During the war, revolutionary newspapers infiltrated every part of society and the country, from remote areas to places where the enemy held controland would be welcomed.The Vietnamese press even reached the overseas audience of like-minded parties and friends around the world, helping the world understand the righteousness of Vietnamese people’s struggles and revolution.On June 2, 1950, the Vietnam Journalists Association was established. In July 1950, the association joined the International Organisation of Journalists.On May 20, 1957, President of the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam Hồ Chí Minh promulgated Law No.100SL/L002, the first press law in the country. Chapter I of the law reaffirmed the responsibility of revolutionary newspapers and journalists: “The press under our administration, whether it belongs to a Government agency, a political party, a mass organisation or a private agency, are all tools of the people's struggles, must serve the interests of the Fatherland and of the people, and protect the people's democracy, and support the Government of the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam.”During the resistance war against American imperialism, the Vietnamese revolutionary press made great strides. The newspapers born during the anti-French resistance war evolved to serve the new mission.In addition to the press agencies already available such as The People, People's Army, the Voice of Vietnam radio, or Vietnam News Agency, a series of newspapers, magazines, radio channels emerged from the central level down to province and city and district level, unions and agencies and sectors. Several foreign-language newspapers were also published to introduce Vietnamese issues to international friends.Over the decades, the revolutionary press has matured considerably in all aspects, becoming a “sharp instrument” of the Party and the State in propaganda, advocacy and education of the whole Party and State to help unite the people to overcome hardship and bring victories to the revolution.In the wars against the French and the Americans, Vietnamese journalists weathered so many challenges and never shied from making sacrifices to be present on all fronts to report the developments of the nation’s struggles against foreign enemies.Thousands of officials and journalists have stood side by side with the army and volunteers on all battlefields. Hundreds of journalist-martyrs have made brave sacrifices for the independence and freedom of the Fatherland.Nearly a century since the first issue of the weekly  newspaper was published, the Vietnamese revolutionary press has blossomed in number and quality.According to data from the Ministry of Information and Communications, by the end of November 2019, the country had a total of 850 press units, including one news agency, 179 newspapers, 648 magazines, 23 independent online news sites; 72 certified radio and television broadcasters including two national broadcasters and 64 local broadcasters.There are about 41,000 people working at press agencies, with 20,407 granted press cards.At all times, the Vietnamese revolutionary press has been the fastest and most popular information instrument, the means to keep in touch with the people and help solve emerging problems, while at the same time, it combats vile conspiracies and tricks of hostile forces as well as erroneous slants in thoughts and actions, and makes contributions to the organisation of the people’s revolutionary action movement.The Vietnamese press has effectively contributed to the protection of the national sovereignty over sea and islands, as well as the Party and State’s crusade against corruption and waste.Press activities have helped maintain political stability, sustaining the cause of innovation, gradually building new people and new lifestyles.The press has promoted new economic and business models, new factors, good people and good deeds; promoted the upholding of the Vietnamese people’s values and cultural traditions, encouraging people to selectively acquire influences from the advanced nations of the world.Reporters and editors have gotten in touch with contemporary life and social concerns, not backing down from danger, to produce quality work.The press has fulfilled its duties as a bridge between the Party and the State and the public, becoming an important information channel for the Party and State in the making of policies and mechanisms that can respond to the interests and demands of the people.However, the Vietnamese press has also revealed some limitations and shortcomings. Many newspapers are similar in content, expression or appearance or vague in identity and mission. Unhealthy competition for views and clicks has also led to the spread of misinformation and unverified reports.To materialise the Party’s viewpoints on building and developing a press system to protect the nation and promote country-building efforts, the Government has issued planning for press agencies until 2025, aiming to reorganise the press system in the country.In the new context, with relentless advancements of information technology and the fierce competition from and between various types of media, the revolutionary press of Việt Nam needs to continue cultivating its special role – serving as the voice of the Party, the State, the country’s various socio-political organisations and professions, a reliable forum of the people, protecting the interests of the people while being a sharp weapon in the fight against hostile forces and struggles against immoralities – to help realise the ambition of a prosperous and robust Việt Nam. — VNSHÀ NỘI — ASEAN foreign ministers and

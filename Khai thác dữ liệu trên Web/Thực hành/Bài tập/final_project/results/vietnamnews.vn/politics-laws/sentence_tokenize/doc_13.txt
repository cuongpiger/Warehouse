Nguyễn Đức Lợi General Director of the Vietnam News Agency speaks about the agencys transition process on the occasion of the 95th anniversary of Vietnamese Revolutionary Press Day June 21Developing multimedia and multiplatform journalism is a common trend in the world today
The Vietnam News Agency has taken concrete steps in recent years and in fact has become a multimedia agency developing all types print radio television online newspaper and books
With all kinds of information on modern technical platforms the Vietnam News Agency constantly strengthens the position of a news agency to provide originalsource information to domestic and international press agencies and provides information directly to the publica television centre and a databasedocumentation and infographic centre and eight editorial offices including Tin Tuc The News newspaper VietnamPlus enewspaper The thao Van hoa Sports Culture newspaper Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Region Pictorial Vietnam Pictorial Viet Nam News Le Courier du Vietnam and Vietnam Law Legal Forum along with five news support centres a publishing house two printing companies the VNA representative office in the south the VNA representative office in the central Central Highlands region and functional units to support the VNA General DirectorWith representative offices in all 63 cities and provinces nationwide and 30 overseas bureaus across the five continents the VNA has a strong contingent of reporters working across the country and in most of the key areas around the world
This is a unique advantage that no other press agency in Việt Nam hasThe launch of VietnamPlus online newspaper in 2008 and the official broadcast of Vietnam News Channel Vnews in 2010 were steps towards the aforementioned target reflecting the vision of the Vietnam News Agency Board at that time
Later to adapt to changes in information needs in 2017 Vietnam News Agency established the DatabaseDocumentation and Infographic Centre which provides a wide range of materials systematically summarised from official sources regarding major current events at home and abroad on the portal vnanetvn and produces a number of TV shows
On September 15 2015 VNA brought VNAs information and news to social networks starting with promoting Vietnamese information then developing in other languages such as English French Chinese and SpanishIn March 2012 I had a business trip to Japan
This trip left a strong impression on me about the quick adaptation of a news agency in the context of constantly developing digital media in which I paid special attention to the information centre in the convergence model of Kyodo News
In my following business trips in many other countries such as China South Korea and Russia or when attending the annual conference of the AsiaPacific News Agency OANA I witnessed the dramatic transformation of leading regional news agencies such as Xinhua News Agency Yonhap and TASS
These companies are fastpaced with the advances of modern communication technology they use robots as television programme instructors apply artificial intelligence to produce sports news develop cloud computing to transmit information directly
From such experience we are more determined to speed up and concretise the steps to bring Vietnam News Agency to become the nations primary multimedia agencyVietnam News Agency is well prepared to catch the trend of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and we have many products of this revolution
VietnamPlus Chatbot application is an example
Along with that there are data journal products using Big Data and Voice to Text system
As for how much we invest in information products it depends on each stage of the development of communication technology and the everchanging needs of the audienceWith agility and focus on investment up to now Vietnam News Agency has had many newspapers and websites successfully applying modern technologies for the production of press products like VietnamPlus newspaper Sport and Culture newspaper and Vnews
We have mega stories Rap News live podcasts infographics timelines 360 photos Audio
The creativity and investment in professionals as well as technology is well received and appreciated by readersIn addition in recent years Vnews has created a breakthrough in the application of new technologies and techniques for production to ensure stable round the clock broadcasting
At the end of 2019 Vnews invested in a new modern newsroom system deploying the 10Gb network infrastructure system
At the same time it successfully built an information storage system and put into operation the MAM online TV operating system which is a professional working support system that ensures transparent workflow quick and accurate informationThe project Developing Vietnam News Agency into a major multimedia agency of the national media system is a name that we have considered both on a legal and practical basis
In the era of digital media thriving under the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution along with the increasing and diverse requirements from the public the Vietnam News Agencys development in the model of multimedia on the basis of multiplatform to promote the strengths of various types of journalism is an inevitable trendRegarding solutions I think every solution must ensure effective implementation of the following specific functions and tasks VNA is the only Vietnamese news agency that provides information for the domestic and foreign press system VNA is the only press agency to provide reference information on the situation in the country and the world serving the leadership of the Party and the Government research and policymaking agencies The Vietnam News Agency is the only press agency tasked by the Secretariat to publish press publications in the languages of all ethnic minority groups in Vietnam The Vietnam News Agency is the only press agency tasked with announcing the official opinion of the State on topical issues adjusting information that is not in line with national interests when it is necessary to issue a statement to reject information that is intentionally misrepresented VNA is the national key foreign information agency VNA is the only press agency with a network of permanent correspondents spread across 63 provinces and cities and is also the press agency with the most resident agencies abroad 30 VNA manages the largest national image archive in Việt NamTo always perform well the above functions and tasks the human factor is decisive
Therefore the development of the Vietnam News Agencys human resources must ensure a sufficient quantity and attach importance to improving the quality through strengthening training and retraining so that the Vietnam News Agency journalists have enough political quality and modern journalism capacity

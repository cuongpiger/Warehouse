favour Notably the NA ruled Peoples Councils and Peoples Committees at the district and communal level can issue legal documents Lê Thị Nga chairwoman of the NA Judicial Affairs Committee said the regulation would empower local administrations to make decisions on issues relevant to the socioeconomic conditions of their locality The new law stipulates that legal documents can only be revised supplemented replaced or revoked by other legal documents of the State agencies which issued the old documents The documents announcing the revocation of legal documents must be published in public newspapers In the morning session lawmakers also looked into the draft law amending and supplementing the Law on Handling Administrative Violations While most deputies agreed on the enforcement of the law they proposed the fine be raised to the maximum to deter violations Many deputies said administrative violations must be handled accordingly and that it was necessary to improve the related legal framework to ensure the rights of the people Deputy Lê Công Định from the northern province of Long An called for additional measures including community service or naming violating individuals and units Deputy Nguyễn Thị Mai Hoa from Đồng Tháp Province agreed that community service should be applied She said this kind of punishment would leave a direct impact on violators as well as on the communitys awareness In some cases administrative punishment was not effective as welloff violators could easily pay the fine Hoa said Phan Thị Bình Thuận a deputy from HCM City said administrative punishment should be reviewed to ensure it was strong enough He emphasised that although administrative punishment was common a penalty which was too low might not be a deterrent Many deputies voiced concerns over halting water and electricity supply to a unit as a punishment saying it may lead to serious consequences Deputy Nguyễn Văn Hiển from Lâm Đồng Province said cutting off electricity and water might damage the property of violaters and innocents alike which is beyond the enforcement requirement for handling administrative violations He suggested such a sanction should only be used for dealing with violations in construction recreation services and producing or trading of contraband or banned goods According to deputy Nguyễn Sỹ Cương from Ninh Thuận Province cutting off electricity and water was inhumane because there would be innocent victims It is unwise to cutting off electricity when the weather is 40 degrees Celsius he said adding that the measure should be applied to construction not to production and trading units VNSHÀ NỘI Legislators voted to pass a law amending and supplementing some articles of the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and the Law on

foundation contributing to institutionalising the Partys policies and guidelines on international integration towards higher quality and efficiency It also dealt with shortcomings of the 2007

about the possibility that disputes might occur and how to handle them after signing international agreements Việt Nam currently has about 11000 communes with more than 600 districts The expanding of signing international agreements to commune level was too large they said Trương Trọng Nghĩa from HCM City suggested only certain agencies at provincial level be given signing authority The provincial committees would sign the agreements instead of the district or communal level regarding to the signatory of international agreements to limit the risk of petitions he said Deputies also passed a draft law amending and supplementing articles of the Construction Law Lawmakers agreed to reform the administrative procedures for granting construction permits especially separate housing works in rural areas Legislators also suggested tightening the management of construction order which is directly linked to granting construction permits They said construction order management is not only

the responsibilities of Peoples Committees at the district and provincial levels according to lawmakers VNSNEW YORK Việt Nam welcomed the results the United Nations UN Investigative Team to promote

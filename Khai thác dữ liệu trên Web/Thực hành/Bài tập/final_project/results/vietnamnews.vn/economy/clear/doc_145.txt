HÀ NỘI — Thailand has stopped imposing anti-dumping tariffs on some imported steel from Việt Nam since June 7, 2020, the Trade Remedies Authority of Việt Nam under the Ministry of Industry and Trade said on its website on June 18.Thailand’s authority said that after six years of applying this tariff, Thailand's steel production has improved. There is no evidence of serious damage or threats to the domestic steel industry due to increased imports, according to the final conclusion issued in May on an anti-dumping investigation for 169 HS codes of non alloy hot rolled steel products in coils and not in coils originating or imported from Việt Nam.Therefore, Thailand does not need to continue imposing this safeguard measure to protect local products against the imports.Thailand initiated an investigation of anti-dumping for Vietnamese steel products in 2014. It had three reviews on this case with the applied tariffs at 21 per cent, 20.87 per cent and 20.74 per cent of cost, insurance and freight (CIF) prices for the three times, respectively, from June 7, 2017 to June 6, 2020. — VNS

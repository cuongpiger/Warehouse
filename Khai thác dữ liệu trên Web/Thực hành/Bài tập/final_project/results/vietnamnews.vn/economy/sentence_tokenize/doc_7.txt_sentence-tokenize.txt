HÀ NỘI The National Assembly passed the EUVietnam Investment Protection Agreement EVIPA yesterday morning in Hà Nội
The agreement will replace current bilateral agreements on investments between Việt Nam and 21 countries in the European Union
The NA recognises and enables the enforcement of final judgements issued by a dispute settlement institution designated to settle investment disputes between Việt Nam and the EU as well as EU members
Within a fiveyear period the recognition and enforcement of the final judgments of which Việt Nam is the defendant will apply under the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
The Supreme Peoples Court was charged to provide information and guidelines to city and provincial courts to follow provisions set in the agreements
PublicPrivate Partnerships In the afternoon the NA passed the PublicPrivate Partnership Law establishing a legal framework to encourage the private sector to invest in infrastructure projects
Some of the highlights of the PublicPrivate Partnership PPP Law The law stipulates five investment priorities which are transport power networks and power plants potable water and treatment of wastewater projects healthcare and education as well as information technology infrastructure
Only projects with total investment amounts exceeding VNĐ200 billion US86 million are eligible for the PPP model
Projects in poor or isolated localities are exceptions to this rule which only require investment amounts from VNĐ100 billion
The States share in PPP projects must not exceed 50 per cent of the investment amount
For the first time a risksharing mechanism is in place that allows the State to provide support for projects whose income is under 75 per cent of the expected income
The risksharing mechanism has been said to be crucial in the States effort to attract private investors
Aside from traditional funding sources such as banks and credit institutions corporates may issue project bonds to help with funding for the projects
The law puts a halt to BuildTransfer projects in the near future as the State is no longer considering and conducting studies for projects under the BuildTransfer model after the introduction of the PPP Law
Speaking on the topic of PPP projects Vũ Tiến Lộc chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry said its high time the State introduces changes to the countrys policies
This is the time to remove barriers and obstacles to make sure the State and private investors could improve resiliency to minimise risk and maximise mutual benefits said Lộc
Đào Việt Dũng an expert on state management and PPP from the Asian Development Bank said PPP projects especially ones with a State investment share should establish their own budgets instead of being part of a public investment budget
A dedicated budget for PPP projects affirms private investors of the States commitment
Banks will also provide loans with lower interest as risk is reduced said Dũng
Đoàn Giang from the United States Agency for International Development said there is a need to clearly include and define banks rights and interests in PPP projects as they often account for large amounts of projects funding

Speaking at the second Industrial Real Estate Forum Tran Thi Hong Minh Director of the Central Institute for Economic Management CIEM said Vietnam had significant opportunities to attract quality FDI given the Governments success in containing the COVID19 pandemic and efforts to recover economic growth postpandemic

Investment in IZs must also take into account labour issues and social security she said
The efficiency of IZs should not only be evaluated based on the occupancy rate export scale and contribution to the State budget but also links among them
According to Tran Quoc Trung Deputy Director of the Economic Zones Management Department under the Ministry of Planning and Investment the development of IZs must promote local strengths and regional links
A system of core IZs must be formed to lead the development of major industries Trung said

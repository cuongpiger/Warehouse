VOVVN An initial tonne of fresh Vietnamese lychees arrived in Japan by air on June 20 as a way of further confirming the value of the nations agricultural products in this highly lucrative market therefore offering greater opportunities for export market expansion in the future
Approximately four tonnes of exports sent on June 18 were transported by sea
Following their arrival in the Far East nation they will then be offered for sale to AEON supermarket and outlets of importers such as VIENT Corporation Yufruit and Sunrise FarmTa Duc Minh Commercial Counselor in Japan outlined how although Japan is not a major lychee import market it still boasts great potential for development as most Japanese consumers are not familiar or do not know much about lychees its taste and how to consume them
Consumption is most popular among Asians who are familiar with and like the taste of fresh lychee items
Therefore promoting these products to Japanese people is an extremely necessary step because the harvest of lychee takes place in a relatively short space of time meaning that the volume of export in one season is negligible Minh addedTherefore producers must take into account products that have deep processing and added value such as frozen lychee fresh lychee juice lychee jelly or other products made from lycheeIt is expected that approximately 200 tonnes of fresh lychee items will be successfully exported to the Japanese market over the course of year
Most notably AEON Group of Japan is set to import 10 tonnes of fresh litchi whilst Yufruit Company and Sunrise Farm will import two tonnes and one tonne respectively

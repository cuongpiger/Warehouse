Vietnams four Stateowned mobile operators Viettel VNPTVinaphone GMobile and MobiFone have just agreed to share some 1200 base transceiver stations BTS a move that Fitch Solutions said would provide a boost to GMobile as the smallest player of the four
The Londonbased analytics firm said in a statement on June 15 that network sharing is still a relatively new paradigm in Vietnams telecom market but networksharing efforts will accelerate in the country in the near future as the Government seeks to streamline network deployments and slash capital spendingOperators have largely pursued the synchronous deployment of their networks which has led to a significant duplication of infrastructure said the firmThe trend is pronounced in denselypopulated urban areas where the rapid construction of mobile masts has also led to safety and environmental concerns from the GovernmentThe Ministry of Information and Communications MIC issued a directive in November 2019 which highlighted the need for fixed and mobile operators to coordinate the construction of networks and develop plans to share infrastructureThe sharing of BTS will also allow operators to save on capital expenditures associated with new constructions which the MIC estimates to be roughly VND1 billion US43000 per BTSIn the 5G era where networks require a significantly higher number of BTS to operate effectively network sharing can greatly reduce redundant investments and allow operators to repurpose funds to develop services which will be the key differentiator in 5G according to Fitch SolutionsOperators have previously touted a mid2020 launch of 5G services and the network sharing deal which we believe will involve BTS situated in major population centers could boost launch prospects said the firmThe deal will also prove to be a boon for GMobile which currently only operates a 2G network
Despite receiving 4G spectrum and licenses in 2016 it appears that the operator has not made any substantial progress in deploying longterm evolution technologyExpressing surprise over this given that GMobile does not have any 3G spectrum Fitch Solutions said it has instead been relying on offering basic 2G calling texting and data services at low prices catered primarily to lowerincome and rural subscribers to gain a market shareThis strategy has resulted in it steadily losing ground to its larger rivals which were able to leverage their scale and capital resources to increase their reachThe analytics firm predicted the network deal could allow GMobile to launch limited 4G or even 5G services although it will need to achieve a more extensive networksharing deal if it were to boost its longterm prospectsThe new deal is relatively small in scale with data from the MIC suggesting that as many as 400000 BTS have been installed by all five mobile operators nationwide

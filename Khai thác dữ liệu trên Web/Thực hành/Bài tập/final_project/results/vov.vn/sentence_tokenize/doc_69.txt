A development strategy is being drawn up for the building material industry for 20212030 with a vision to 2050 as the management and development of the sector are still facing a number of shortcomings
According to a report at a working session in Hanoi on June 18 the building material industry has continually been invested and developed over the past years
The design capacity and production output of some products have risen twice or three times compared to 10 15 years ago
Thanks to product diversity and quality meeting developed countries standards the sector has met the growing domestic demand and had its products exported
In particular Vietnam is currently the fifth biggest cement manufacturer in the world after China India the US and Russia
Its cement output has doubled within 10 years from 455 million tonnes in 2009 to about 100 million tonnes turning the country from a cement and clinker importer to the worlds largest exporter of these commodities with over 30 million tonnes shipped aboard in 2018 doubling the figure of Thailand that stood second
However there remain a number of shortcomings in the management and development of building materials participants heard
Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Concrete Association Tran Ba Viet said the country ranks fifth in terms of cement production but the cement export value is still low while this is an energy and natural resourceintensive sector
He suggested considering the export of precast concrete blocks which have much higher value while minising the shipment of clinker and cement
Echoing the view Chairman of the Vietnam Association for Building Materials Tong Van Nga said the country is exporting many cheap building materials
Meanwhile it has yet to optimise byproducts and waste of other industries such as coal residues of cement and chemical production and thermal power plants to produce building materials
At the meeting Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said the building material sector has obtained major achievements but is still facing difficulties and challenges including low content of creativity and added value in products lack of new products able to compete with regional and global rivals and insufficient attention to research and development
He noted the most important task for the industry in the time ahead is meeting domestic demand so as to contribute to the construction sector and socioeconomic development
As global demand for building materials will also increase the development of this sector will also help boost export he added
To that end a development strategy for 20212030 with a vision for 2050 is necessary the Deputy PM said requesting that it must associate the sectors development with modern technology application natural resources and energy saving waste recycle low carbon emissions climate change adaptation and environmental protection

Ho Chi Minh City will focus on major transport projects that help ease traffic gridlock and scrap less urgent ones since resources are limited
The Department of Transport said it had developed a transport infrastructure plan for the next decade with a focus on the criteria that would determine the priority of projects based on planning simulation and traffic forecast
Tran Quang Lam the departments director said priority would be given to belt roads highways and urban railways metro No 1 2 3B 5
Other urgent projects include elevated roads and others that connect with Tan Son Nhat airport Cat Lai port and Hiep Phuoc port
HCM City mainly depended on public funding of transport projects he said adding that it has difficulty mobilising private capital
Vice Chairman of the municipal Peoples Committee Vo Van Hoan said the city had spent 375 of public investment in 20162020 on transport infrastructure
Now due to limited resources it would have to focus on congestion hotspots such as airport seaports and roads to neighbouring provinces he said
It had worked closely with districts to promptly resolve problems related to land acquisition and compensation to speed up progress he said
It would ask the municipal Party Committee and Peoples Council for permission to scrap projects considered less urgent he said
In 20162020 the city completed a number of key transport works such as Pham Van Dong street the road leading to Phu Huu port in district 9 the flyover at the Go May intersection the intersection near the HCM City National University and the flyovers at Vo Van Kiet street and the Go Vap intersection according to the Peoples Committee
They are now playing a major role in reducing congestion and accidents in the city
According to the Management Board for Traffic Works Construction and Investment the city will complete 29 traffic projects and start work on 27 new ones this year
Of the 27 new projects the city has already kicked off 13 major projects with a total investment of VND35 trillion US149 million

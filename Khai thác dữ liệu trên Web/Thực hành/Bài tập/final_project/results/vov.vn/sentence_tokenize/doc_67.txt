Trade and investment relations between Vietnam and the UK are to benefit from the EUVietnam Free Trade Agreement EVFTA according to Trade Counsellor at the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK Nguyen Canh Cuong
Developing trade and investment ties with Vietnam is a priority for many UK businesses and once the deal takes effect they will have a range of investment opportunities and are likely to shift existing investment to Vietnam
He said the EUVietnam Investment Protection Agreement EVIPA is waiting for ratification from parliaments in some EU member nations which along with the EVFTA has created trust among EU investors
Vietnam holds advantages in trade and investment relations with the EU and other countries in the region thanks to the two agreements as within ASEAN only Singapore has signed an FTA with the EU
Vietnam with nearly 100 million consumers will be a more attractive market for European investors
COVID19 is also changing trade practices in the UK with dependence on Chinese suppliers being lessened
The UK is likely to establish new trade channels with businesses from countries it has signed FTAs with and those parties to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for TransPacific Partnership CPTPP
Cuong added that the EVFTA will help raise the competitiveness of many Vietnamese products over equivalents from countries without an FTA with the UK such as China India Thailand Malaysia Indonesia the Philippines Myanmar and Brazil

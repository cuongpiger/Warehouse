The Prime Minister has requested the Ministry of Planning and Investment MPI propose suitable management solutions for solar power projects to ensure national security
The Government Office has released this PM direction on this issue for the MPI the Ministry of Industry and Trade and relevant agencies after local media has reported that a Thai investor has acquired solar power projects in Binh Phuoc
According to reports Thailands Super Energy Corporation Company Limited Super Energy has announced it has acquired the Loc Ninh 1 2 3 4 solar power projects in Binh Phuoc by buying those plants shares from intermediary companies with a total investment of US4567 million
Of which the investment is US997 million to the Loc Ninh 1 solar power project US140 million to the Loc Ninh 2 US105 million to Loc Ninh 3 and US112 million to Loc Ninh 4
Before investing in the four solar power projects Super Energy owned six other solar power projects in Vietnam
As of March 2020 those six projects alone had a total capacity of up to 28672 MW half the total capacity of Super Energys 100 solar power projects in Thailand
Super Energys power projects in Vietnam have had a return on investment EIRR of 1213 while the Loc Ninh 1234 solar power projects have much higher EIRR between from 1659 to 174
The Thai investor has also purchased shares in a series of other solar projects in other provinces including Ninh Thuan and An Giang and shares in four wind power projects in Bac Lieu Soc Trang Phu Yen and Gia Lai provinces
These projects are expected to be in full or partial operation from the fourth quarter of 2021
With the forms of joint venture or share transfer with Vietnamese enterprises many foreign energy and investment groups have owned dozens of solar and wind power projects enjoying preferential rates of 935 US cents per kWh for 20 years in Vietnam the Tien Phong Vanguard newspaper reported
Of which Thanh Thanh Cong Group and Gulf Energy Group Thailand have set up a joint venture from mid2019 to put investment to two solar power plants in Tay Ninh province TTC 1 and TTC 2
The Gulf has increased its holding to 90 of shares at the two plants from 49 in 2019
It also holds 95 of shares at wind power projects in Ben Tre province
Besides Thailand many investors from Singapore China and Philippines have owned many solar and wind power projects in Vietnam
At present more than 30 provinces and cities nationwide have solar power projects raising concerns about broken electric planning and environmental problems
According to experts Vietnam has had a strong development of solar projects after the State announced the attractive power purchase price at 935 US cents per kWh equivalent to VND2086 per kWh for solar power projects starting operation before June 31 2019
This price would be for those projects within 20 years
As a result more than 300 solar power projects have been registered after this decision breaking the Electricity Development Plan VII
The Ministry of Industry and Trade MoIT noted the hot development of solar power projects has created a lack of synchronisation with development of transmission infrastructure at present
Vietnam is expected to have a total solar power output of at least 7 GW this year too higher than the 08 GW national target for this year according to the studies conducted by the GIZ German development cooperation agencys Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Project and the MoITs Department of Electricity and Renewable Energy
Of which Binh Thuan has nearly 100 solar power projects with a capacity of 4000 MW exceeding the planning at the Electricity Development Plan VII
This number of solar power projects is 10 times higher than wind power projects
This has led to a mismatch and deployment which has led to a serious overload for the electricity network system of the region
Ninh Thuan an attractive investment destination for power companies has 30 solar power projects with a total capacity of up to 1817 MW and a total investment capital of VND50 trillion approved by the Prime Minister and the MoIT
This province estimates to have 26 more solar power projects with a total capacity of 3600 MW
With massive solar power projects landing to many localities such as Ninh Thuan Binh Thuan Tay Ninh Gia Lai Hau Giang and Quang Ngai the MoIT reported by the end of 2019 a total capacity of about 15000 MW from solar power projects have been approved by the Prime Minister and the MoIT to put into the Electricity Development Plan VII
That has created difficulties in developing the electrical grid in the regions nationwide and building electric transmission infrastructure for solar power projects connecting the national electrical grid according to MoIT

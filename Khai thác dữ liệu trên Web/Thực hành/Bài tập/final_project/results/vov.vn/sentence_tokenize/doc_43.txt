Experts have forecast bank credit growth in the second quarter to reach 354 much higher than the rate in the first quarter
In the first three months the rates had been 01 007 and 11 as the COVID19 pandemic severely impacted various industries and their demand for funds
Consumer demand and foreign trade were also badly hit
The State Bank of Vietnam SBV said in the first quarter many businesses increased repayment of existing debts while not borrowing afresh
Experts say the situation has been improving in the second quarter with demand from credit from businesses and individuals showing signs of increasing
In Hanoi total loans outstanding at credit institutions in May were estimated at VND2163 trillion US94 million representing a 24 increase for the year
Credit growth is expected to improve significantly thanks to many proactive measures taken by the Government and central bank recently to revive the economy
For instance the SBV has cut benchmark interest rates the latest occasion being on May 12 when the refinancing rate was reduced to 45 from 5 the discount rate to 3 from 35 and the overnight interbank lending rate to 55 from 6
Fitch Solutions experts forecast a further 50 basis point cut that would take the refinancing rate down to 4 and discount rate to 25 by the end of this year
The cuts are likely to have a strong impact on the economy by encouraging banks to reduce their lending interest rates and boost demand for credit experts say
Besides low deposit interest rates especially for the short term has helped and will help banks reduce their cost of funds further giving a further fillip to lending interest rate cuts
The Government recently gave a fivemonth extension for payment of taxes and land use fees for businesses hit by the pandemic which come to an estimated VND180 trillion benefiting 98 of firms in the country
All these measures are expected to help increase the credit demand
The Governments policy of identifying public investment as the engine for economic growth which has stalled due to the pandemic has placed the focus on speeding up disbursement of public investment
While other investment sources have slowed down increasing public investment planned at nearly VND700 trillion this year should be useful in accelerating postpandemic economic growth thus creating more employment and increasing credit demand
Though credit growth is expected to be only 910 this year compared to 13 last year paradoxically some banks have nearly reached their fullyear credit quota and are asking the central bank for more credit quotas as they have nearly reached the threshold
VPB for instance has crossed 12 while it has a fullyear quota of 13
Its CEO said the bank had turned its lending focus to customers less affected by the pandemic since the beginning of this year
TPBank announced at its annual general meeting recently that its credit growth by the end of April was 11 meaning it had only 05 left
It is expected to ask the central bank to increase its limit to 15 this year
HDBanks loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter were worth VND16206 trillion US69 billion up 592 for the year much higher than the industry average
It reported steady growth across all segments like individual customers small and mediumsized enterprises and consumer loans
It attributed the high growth rate to signing contracts with enterprises late last year
Experts have warned that if these banks credit quotas for the year are not increased they the business sector and indeed the entire economy would face trouble
Though exports are hit by the pandemic the demand for investment and production of goods in the country remains high meaning the demand for credit is still significant
This years credit growth is likely to reach 910 lower than the central banks 1114 target but any change is possible they added
Balance of trade payments surpluses keep the VND steady The COVID19 pandemic has hit global trade hard but some of Vietnams exports have escaped its worst effects which has helped keep the VNDUSD exchange rate steady
In the first five months of the year Vietnams biggest export earners were processed and manufactured goods of which 17 generated at least US1 billion each
Electronics computers and accessories accounted for US153 billion a yearonyear increase of 221
Exports of machinery equipment components and tools reached US85 billion a 25 rise
While several agricultural products saw a drop coffee and cashew achieved slight increases
According to the General Statistics Office Vietnams total trade in the first five months was worth US1968 billion a decrease of 28 against the same period last year
It enjoyed a surplus of US19 billion
This means there has been a substantial inflow of foreign currency stabilising the exchange rate
Since the end of last year the dollar rate at banks has appreciated by only VND92 or 024
Speaking about the influence of the yuan on the VND experts said the depreciation of the Chinese currency has only had a marginal effect so far
The confrontation between the US and China has shown no signs of ending which could further depreciate the yuan but the Chinese Government does not seem to have plans to sharply devalue the currency
Meanwhile Vietnam still pursues a strategy of keeping the exchange rate steady
The country is also running a balance of payments surplus which gives it a further cushion
The VND is expected to escape volatility caused by external factors through this year

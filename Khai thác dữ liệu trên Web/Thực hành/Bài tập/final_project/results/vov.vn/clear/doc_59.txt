Despite significant deals from Japanese investors during the first five months of the year, the development of mergers and acquisitions in real estate remains uncertain in the second half of the year due to the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
In January, Mitsubishi Corporation and Nomura Real Estate Co., Ltd. acquired the majority shares (80%) of the Grand Park Project by Vinhomes, including over 10,000 units of condominiums in Ho Chi Minh City.According to Mitsubishi, this township covers approximately 365 hectares in total and will include offices, residences, sports and commercial facilities, schools, hospitals, and parks for about 200,000 people.Not being a newcomer in Vietnamâ€™s M&A market, Mitsubishi had previously co-operated with local property developer Bitexco to create 240 low-rise housing units and two high-rise condominiums out of a proposed total of more than 1,000 low-rises and 17 high-rises at The Manor Central Park project in Hanoi.

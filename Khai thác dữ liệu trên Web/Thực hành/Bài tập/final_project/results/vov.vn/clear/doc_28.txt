VOV.VN - The northern province of Hai Duong province successfully shipped an initial batch of 1.2 tonnes of fresh lychees to the Japanese market on June 23.
The first batch of lychees is expected to arrive in Japan by air on June 24, before being introduced to the Japanese market seven hours after their arrival.A local grower stated that lychees from his garden had been purchased by the enterprise at VND30,000 per kilo, a figure that is far higher than domestic prices. Aside from traditional markets, lychees from Hai Duong have been able to make inroads into two tricky markets, notably Japan and Singapore, over the past year.Nguyen Khac Tien, chairman of the board of directors of Ameii Vietnam JSC, said that this represents the company’s fourth batch of lychees exported to the Far East nation, noting that the firm also exported 60 tonnes of lychees to Singapore, with Hai Duong lychees accounting for 50%. Pham Van Khanh, Chairman of the People's Committee of Thanh Thuy Commune in Thanh Ha district, emphasised that this marks the first time that the Hai Duong lychees have been successfully exported to the Japanese market. At present, Thanh Thuy is home to over 340 hectares of lychee growing areas, of which 77 hectares are grown in line with VietGAP and Global GAP standards. Indeed, th selling price of lychees that follow VietGAP and GlobalGAP procedures are always 10% to 15% higher than the prices of other lychees  on the local market.

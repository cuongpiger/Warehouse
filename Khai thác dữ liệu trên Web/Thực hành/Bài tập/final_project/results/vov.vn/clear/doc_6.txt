VOV.VN - In their respective current capacity as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council (UNSC), both Vietnam and Indonesia have spoken highly of the EU’s leading role in promoting multilateralism during a UNSC teleconference held on May 28.
The pair both expressed their hope that the EU will continue to collaborate closely alongside the UN to boost co-operation in areas such as conflict settlement, mediation, humanitarian assistance, as well as promoting multilateralism based on the principles set out in the UN Charter.   The two diplomats went on to highlight ASEAN’s recent contributions to building a peaceful, secure, and prosperous region in Southeast Asia. In addition, the bloc is also helping to create a favourable environment for its partners in which to build trust, reinforce preventive diplomacy, minimise differences, and get involved in issues of common interest.Proposals have been made that regional organisations, including the EU and ASEAN, should work closely alongside the UN to address issues relating to the EU’s commitment to increasing the capacity building of UN peace-keeping forces of ASEAN member states, in addition to sharing information in this regard. During the event, European Commission Vice President Josep Borrell, who is also the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, voiced his support for a rule-based international order, in which the UN plays a central role. Borrell noted that multilateralism itself is at stake, with countries needing to act in a manner to support UN reform as a means of combating unilateralism and other negative forms of politics.

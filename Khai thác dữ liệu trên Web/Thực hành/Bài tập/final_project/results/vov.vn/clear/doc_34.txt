Covering an area of 65.2ha, it was invested by the Ninh Thuan Energy Industry, a subsidiary of the T&T Group, at a cost of more than VND1 trillion (US$43 million). Construction began in March and was completed 15 days ahead of schedule despite the impact of COVID-19, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ninh Thuan Energy Industry Pham Cong Doan said.The plant was connected to the national grid on June 10 and will generate an estimated 75 million kWh per year. Vice Chairman of the Ninh Thuan Provincial People’s Committee Pham Van Hau said the inauguration of the plant marks a significant milestone for the province, as it will contribute to local social-economic development and help ensure national energy security.The T&T Group is carrying out a number of other projects in clean energy, including a US$6 billion LNG project in southern Ba Ria-Vung Tau province, another worth US$4.4 billion in central Quang Tri province, and a waste-to-energy plant in Hanoi.

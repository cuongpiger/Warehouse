David Stilwell the State Departments assistant secretary for east Asia and Pacific affairs said Monday that China Central Television China News Service Peoples Daily and the Global Times would have to report details of their US staffing and what their US real estate holdings are to the State Department
These entities are not independent news organizations they are effectively controlled by the Chinese Communist Party also known as propaganda outlets Stilwell said
Furthermore our action will increase transparency on the control of information not just among their state propaganda outlets but also amongst legitimate journalists and news gatherings in China
This is the second time the US has designated Chinese media outlets as foreign entities requiring them to submit to the rules and regulations that cover diplomatic missionsThe designations come as USChina ties have been mired in acrimony over trade the future of Hong Kong and the coronavirus pandemic
With the general election just over four months away President Donald Trumps reelection prospects uncertain and the global economy in shambles because of the virus there is a push inside the White House and among the Presidents Republican allies to shift the blame to China and stress its failure to act quickly and transparently to prevent the virus from spreading into a global pandemicThe announcement about the four Chinese media outlets also comes just days after revelations from a new book by John Bolton Trumps former national security adviser who wrote that Xi Jinping for help in winning the 2020 election
While the Chinese Communist Party has always tightly controlled Chinas state news agencies its control has tightened in recent years decades particularly under Xi Stilwell said
These people are doing more than just propaganda right and to understand exactly what that is we have to know who they are
Its about understanding whats going on inside your own country were a free nation Stilwell addedEarlier this year five other Chinese outlets as foreign missions and capped the number of Chinese journalists working for those outlets in the US
China has expelled journalists from The New York Times The Wall Street Journal and The Washington PostWhen asked about the effectiveness of this effort given Chinas retaliation in expelling US journalists the last time the State Department took this action Stilwell said The Chinese government does what it does
You cant say that theyre doing it specifically because were doing to them
Its simply an excuse
While Stilwell and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus stressed Chinese medias lack of freedom favorably contrasting it with US media Ortagus would not allow a question about Boltons book which also paints Trump as trying to curry favor with Xi

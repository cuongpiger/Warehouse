In a Monday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was extremely concerned about the decision to file espionage charges against Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor who have been detained in China since 2018
These charges are politically motivated and completely groundless Pompeo said
The United States stands with Canada in calling on Beijing for the immediate release of the two men and rejects the use of these unjustified detentions to coerce Canada

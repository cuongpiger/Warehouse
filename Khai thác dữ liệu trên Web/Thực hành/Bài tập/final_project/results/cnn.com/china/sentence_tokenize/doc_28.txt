Social media is teeming with speculation that some unidentified party was mucking about in a US election Russianstyle using the TikTok algorithm to viralize the ticket purchase exhortation videos
The apps Chinese origins did nothing to quell conspiracy theories
Vice journalist Tim Pool dramatically One of the tactics used by Russia to meddle was the use of social media to manipulate public perception
This is a Chinese app facilitating the largest most impactful election meddling we have seen yet assuming its true
TikTok in October of 2019 that it does not operate in China and has denied that US user data is stored on Chinese servers and most crucially We are not influenced by any government including the Chinese government
I am the first person to be skeptical of any corporateese defense
But even if TikTok is lying why make the leap that the Chinese Communist Party has any interest in catfishing American teenagers using fake Kpop social media accounts
Has the Party interfered in other viral interests of this demographic like high school promposals or the TV show RiverdaleAnother Twitter user implied that Kpop accounts were Chinese in origin
A congressional hopeful Hey aoc How many of these teens were US Citizens
A rightwing lawyer and selfdescribed satirist asked Did aoc use the Chinese Communistparty owned tiktok_us to interfere in a Presidential election
Such theories while amusing make no sense
Anything is possible of course but it seems more plausible by an overwhelming margin that KPop fans deserve the credit for their Trump rally activism
As a former math geek I was curious about the inner workings of the allegedly manipulated TikTok algorithm but I did not even see evidence that the conspiracy theorists knew what an algorithm was
Calling this a conspiracy is dismissive provincial and racist for more than one reason
First of all such poohpoohing implies that Asian music couldnt possibly be popular enough in the US to mobilize action on this scale
It also severely underestimates the eagerness of Gen Z Kpop fans to support the Black Lives Matter movement
Earlier this month in the days following the death of George Floyd Kpop fans with Kpop memes and fancams so they could mute the online reach of hateful posts
The Occams razor explanation for the TikTok rebellion is the most accurate one when there are competing explanations for an occurrence the simpler one is better
Despite the doubters the simple reality is that yes there really are this many Kpop fans in the US last year for example BTS became the to have three albums hit number one on the Billboard top 200 within a oneyear period
Furthermore Kpop bands are very active on TikTok which may explain the platforms popularity among global Kpop fans
While its true that the Korean government were early investors in exporting Korean pop culture its not true that BTS is funded by the government
No one is messing with the algorithmIn 2012 after Psys Gangnam Style became a sensation a white male editor I know was irrationally perturbed
He told me There is no way the Gangnam Style video really had a billion people viewing it
The Koreans paid 100000 people in China to click on the link 100000 times
The nice word for that theory would be illogical
Have you seen Gangnam Style
If you havent trust me its not the video that South Korea wants to be remembered for
These allegations about Trumps rally have an undercurrent of the type of denial that happens at an empires end in this case the American inability to accept that a US political event could be that easily eclipsed by another countrys pop culture
Someone with the handle CultureWarlord made a claim Ive heard many times in antifan emails addressed to me There is no such thing as KPop allies
All these KPop accounts are Chinese phone farms
Big expose coming
Why will a certain type of person refuse to believe that people outside Korea especially Americans like Kpop that much
This resistance may be rooted in the same mentality that causes many Americans to resist the metric system soccer and wearing masks during global pandemics
They see such phenomena as foreign and possibly emasculating invasions
The most kneeslapping bit of this whole incident was that it had some pretty powerful people quaking in their boots over a force even scarier than foreign hackers and from a demographic that cant even vote yet the mighty Gen Z who were the driving force behind the action
Oh how we underestimated them
In the last decade or so after broadband became cheap and ubiquitous the Cassandras of the world were terrified what would become of the first generation in history to be raised with easy access to all the information in the world
Many parents worried in the back of their minds that their children might become early porn addicts or have a shaky moral compass dictated either by apathy or aggression fueled by violent multiuser videogames
Imagine the grownups collective surprise that GenZers found an unprecedented terrifying way to the President and his supporters at least to wield influence
Though some referred to the teens activism in more derisive terms as a prank Twitter was still aTwitter with boasting that their teen had trolled the leader of the free world
We live in strange times in which the truism correlation is not causation seems less and less accurate
You wouldnt assume that being a Trump supporter would correlate with refusal to wear a mask during a deadly epidemic but the photos of that underattended rally are an unmistakable if spotty sea of bare faces
And you wouldnt think that Kpop fans and GenZ social media addicts would become a defining force against white supremacy yet here we are
And theyre just warming up
Next time it will seem less like a prank and more like the Velvet Revolution yet entirely online

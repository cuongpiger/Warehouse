It was the single largest margin of victory ever at a mens or womens
In the games aftermath the USWNT would be subjected to criticism that they had celebrated too much or that they had been too ruthless in their thumping of ThailandAfter the match in Reims striker Alex Morgan who contributed five goals tying a Womens World Cup record spoke to reporters and said From a sporting perspective she was right but it was hard not to feel a little for the Thai players given it was the countrys only secondever appearance at a Womens World Cup
It was a nightmare for us Thai national team forward told CNN Sport
We are not satisfied with the result but it helped us understand a higher quality of football
I thought they gave us a lesson to improve our team
Thai television presenter Peerapol Champ Euariyakul added I think a lot of the players they were ignited by the situation and they were telling me that it pushed them more that the next time even when they have to lose the margin should be smaller
And smaller it was
Thailand were beaten 51 by Sweden in their next match but that singular goal gave the team and the country some hope
I think it inspired a lot of people that they can make the impossible possible
Euariyakul said
I think when they scored that one goal its like a win for Thai people
Nualphan Lamsam who was the teams general manager during Thailands past two World Cup appearances was seen on television cameras crying after the goal was scored
They are tears of joy Lamsam told CNN Sport
I am so proud of my team seeing everyone playing with their full capability under the pressure accumulated since the heavy loss from the first match with the United States
Winning and losing are not important what really matters for us the most and what we are most proud of is the wonderful spirits of Thai football players
So whats next for womens football in Thailand
Euariyakul and Sornsai both believe it comes down to the domestic league
Lamsams family company sponsors the fledgling womens league and players on the national team are also employed by her companyThe league is currently semiprofessional but at a time when equal pay dominates the headlines in womens sport Champ says it goes deeper than that in Thailand
The key to success is the professional league
If the players dont have the professional league after the World Cup they have to go and be a salary person which they dont want to do
They want to play sports fulltime
And if our association says we need a professional league I think we can go and we can compete more competitively
Sornsai agrees
She came up playing in various youth and schoolbased leagues and has been playing with the national team since 2005 earning 115 caps along the way
I hope it Muang Thai Womens League will become a professional league in the future said Sornsai
They have to set up academies for womens football to produce many talented players
Second they have to set a higher standard in education competition and organization
Finally they have to invest more in facilities to improve and have success in the future
In this moment womens football is more popular in Thailand added Somsai
We can use this momentum to create more women players and improve the standard
Lamsam believes her efforts over her eights years at the helm were not in vein
I want to establish pride and make everyone know about our Thai womens football team she said
Although football is the popular sport worldwide it only referred to mens games in Thailand
Euariyakul agrees and thinks womens matches should be played before mens games to help get fans in the stands and the league itself needs to be more visible
The most important thing is we should promote and we should watch more womens games
We just broadcast the World Cup its like a bubble
It comes on once in four years and I dont think thats enough
You need a strong belief like in England you need to broadcast the game every week
As the announcement of the host for the 2023 draws near Sornsai who would be 34 during the tournament knows that the Thais arent at the level they need to be yet but theyre getting there
We hope we can go to play in the World Cup again and then of course close the big gap from the top teams

To even come close you have to go back three and half decades to David Stockman President Ronald Reagans director of the Office of Management and Budget and his 1986 The Triumph of Politics Why the Reagan Revolution Failed which painted a deeply unflattering portrait of Reagan and his senior White House advisers
But Boltons book The Room Where It Happened makes Stockmans look like one of the socalled that the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has routinely sent to the easilyflattered and bottomlessly narcissistic President Donald Trump
Boltons portrayal of Trump is devastating
And it will be hard for Trump supporters to paint him as some pinko liberal since he volunteered as a teenager to work for the Barry Goldwater campaign then interned for Spiro Agnew and went on to work in Republican administrations going back to Reagan
Bolton was also a frequent and bellicose presence on Fox News before he joined the Trump administration
Its not hard to understand why Trump has sought to block the books publication and has branded it a pack of liesSome Trump allies have that Bolton who received a reported 2 million book advance is larding up his memoir with untruths to sell books
This seems unlikely
Bolton is already quite well off according to his 2018 financial earning more than half a million dollars a year from Fox News alone before he joined the Trump administration and possessing many millions of dollars in stocks and other property
There may be a simpler explanation for why Bolton wrote his tellall book which is being published Tuesday
Unlike Trump who was born with a platinum spoon in his mouth Bolton is the son of a Baltimore firefighter who by dint of smarts and hard work went to Yale University and then Yale Law School
Subsequently Bolton working at everhigher levels in four Republican administrations
Whatever you think of his views he had spent a long career studying the issues facing those at the highest levels of the national security apparatus in contrast to Trump who had done absolutely no serious preparation for the decisions he would have to make as president
Boltons personal contempt for Trump oozes from almost every page
In the 500plus page memoir its hard to find any moment where Trump is portrayed in any kind of positive light
Indeed Trump took an action which Bolton wholeheartedly approved of ordering the killing in early January of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani who ran Irans military operations around the Middle East yet it goes unmentioned in Boltons memoir
In the immediate aftermath of the event Bolton Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qassem Soleimani
Long in the making this was a decisive blow against Irans malign Quds Force activities worldwide
Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran
There would have been plenty of time for Bolton to include praise for the in his manuscript since it occurred many weeks before the full emergence of the coronavirus crisis in the US a subject the former national security adviser covers devastatingly
When the crisis hit according to Boltons book the chair behind the Resolute desk was empty referring to the presidents desk in the Oval Office
On one level The Room Where It Happened is a blistering bitter takedown of the president who Bolton describes as ignorant of such basic facts as that the United Kingdom is a nuclear power a commander in chief who blathered through many of his own intelligence briefings and who changed his mind on a dime we made a weathervane look like the Rock of Gibraltar and who filtered all his decisions through an electoral lens even to the extent of encouraging Chinese President Xi Jinping to help him get reelected by purchasing more goods from American farmers
Bolton observes I am hardpressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasnt driven by reelection calculations
At another level The Room Where It Happened is also a searing indictment of the Trump administrations incoherent foreign policy in which of course Bolton played a starring role in as Trumps National Security Adviser even as he often privately thought that much of Trumps foreign policy was going off the rails
Bolton describes Trumps foreign policy thusly Trump was not following any international grand strategy or even a consistent trajectory
His thinking was like an archipelago of dots like individual real estate deals leaving the rest of us to discernor createpolicy
Take all those love letters from Chairman Kim as Trump has often referred to the North Korean dictator in his frequent tweets about him
Bolton who has spent a good chunk of his professional life working on arms control issues in his 2007 memoir Surrender is Not an Option that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily and that any promises to do so were simply to lift sanctions against it
North Korea Bolton wrote has followed this game plan many times and it has every reason to believe it will succeed in the future
Quite so
As Boltons new memoir amply documents Chairman Kim played Trump like a Stradivarius showing up for meetings with Trump in Singapore in 2018 and the following year at the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea that were no more than great photo ops
Yet the North Koreans have done absolutely nothing to denuclearize which for decades has been the bedrock aim of US policy on North Korea
At the Singapore meeting Bolton describes Trump unliterally giving away concessions to Kim such as canceling joint USSouth Korea military exercises a longtime cornerstone of containing the nucleararmed North Korean rogue state and getting nothing in return
Bolton says Trump didnt consult any members of his cabinet when he told Kim the exercises would be canceled blindsiding both the Pentagon and Bolton
Trump told Kim that North Korea was doing the US a big favor because cancelling the exercises saved the United States a lot of money
Bolton writes that when Trump made this remark Kim was smiling broadly laughing from time to time
The jovial dictator had correctly pegged Trump as an easy mark
Ditto for Russian President Vladimir Putin who Trump infamously defended over his own intelligence community when he stood by Putin at a press conference in Helsinki in July 2018 and said that he believed the former KGB officers assurances that Russia hadnt interfered in the 2016 US presidential election
Bolton describes how he and Trumps chief of staff John Kelly were almost frozen in our seats when Trump made this selfinflicted wound that led to catastrophic media coverageIf Trump loves kowtowing to dictators he also enjoys dumping on close allies
Trumps first Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has NATO as the most successful alliance in modern history but rather than seeing NATO as a mutual self defense alliance that serves American interests very well Trump sees it as a constellation of countries that are ripping off the United States
Trump often told Bolton and other key advisers that he planned to pull out of NATO which makes about as much sense as closing down the Federal Reserve another favorite Trump targetNATO countries have to spend at least 2 of their GDP on defense spending by 2024
For Trump countries such as Germany that havent yet met this 2 target owe us a tremendous amount of money as he said publicly when visiting headquarters in Brussels in July 2018
In fact the US is not owed any of this money
In Brussels Trump added for good measure that Germany is totally controlled by Russia a bizarre since the Soviets had indeed once controlled East Germany during the Cold War but hadnt done so since the Berlin Wall had fallen
What the United States gains by Trumps alienation of close American allies such as Germany and cozying up to longtime US enemies like Putin has never been clear and Bolton doesnt explore in his book what longer term damage Trump may have done to Americas alliances
Nor does Bolton engage in any selfreflection about why he chose to serve and ultimately to enable someone as chaotic and incompetent as Trump
Bolton who has publicly advocated for regime change in Iran was of course delighted that Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal a few weeks after Bolton was appointed National Security Adviser in March 2018
Bolton was far less happy when a 130 million US by the Iranians in June 2019 and Trump called back at the very lastminute a Pentagonplanned retaliatory attack against Iranian military facilities
The President told Bolton that there would be too many body bags
Bolton fumes that it was the most irrational thing I ever witnessed a President do
In fact Trump likely showed some good judgment here as the US drone was of course unmanned and killing Iranian soldiers on the ground in response likely would have provoked some kind of escalatory reaction by the Iranian regimeOn Afghanistan Bolton describes Trump constantly confusing the former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and the current Afghan president Ashraf Ghani while pursuing an incoherent policy of simultaneously having the State Department negotiate with the Taliban to draw down all US troops to zero while the Pentagon and Bolton were planning to keep thousands of American troops in Afghanistan to pursue counterterrorism missions against al Qaeda and ISIS
This incoherent policy continues to this dayThere is a fair amount of score settling in the book
Trumps former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is described to Bolton by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as light as a feather
Trumps soninlaw Jared Kushner is taken to task for his fantasy of bringing peace to the Middle East where the likes of Kissinger had failed
Both former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are portrayed as weak
The media is invariably described as a press mob
Meanwhile Bolton always positions himself as the smartest guy in the room where it happened
One episode that doesnt suggest that this was always the case was the key role that Bolton played in trying to eject from power the Cubabacked leader of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro in favor of the opposition leader Juan Guaidó
The whole effort fizzled and Maduro is today
On Trumps dealings with Ukraine which led to his impeachment trial Bolton says the president was convinced by the crazy conspiracy theory that Ukraine was actually responsible for carrying out Moscows efforts to hack US elections
Part of that conspiracy theory involves the barmy idea that the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by the Russians can be found in Ukraine
Trump tells members of his cabinet including Bolton I want that fg server
Americans now has a president who lives in serious tin foil hat landBolton ABC News that he wrote his book to tell a complete picture of what he saw during the Trump administration and let readers make up their own decisions about what it all means
In five months many of those readers who have already made Boltons memoir the top nonfiction Amazon bestseller of 2020 will have an opportunity to do just that

I want you to imagine for a moment life in a refugee camp you and your family packed in a dense overcrowded space
You share a bathroom with everyone in the community
You try to wash your hands but theres barely any soap and water
Now think about all that in the middle of a pandemic
Given all thats going on in the country right now its sometimes hard to think about the plight of others far away
But when we say were all in this together that means everyone
One of the most vulnerable populations on the front lines of coronavirus are the worlds refugees
My mom lived the first 12 years of her life as a refugee
And I often think about what her life would have been had it also been in the middle of a pandemic
In this episode my colleague Bex Wright whos based in Hong Kong and covers the Rohingya shares the story of one of the most atrisk communities in the worldIm Dr Sanjay Gupta CNNs chief medical correspondent
And this is
Thank you Sanjay
Now the Rohingya are an ethnic Muslim minority in the northwest of Myanmar which is a majority Buddhist country and formerly known as Burma
I first started covering them in 2016 as they began to flee Myanmar
A lot of them have actually been violently driven out as the government doesnt recognize them as legitimate citizens
The UN describes them as the most persecuted minority on earth
Once more we are hearing about torture mutilation repeated massacres gang rapes and obliteration of entire villagesEarlier this year the International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar to prevent acts of genocide against the Rohingya and to stop destroying evidence
Myanmar for its part has always denied genocide
My sons and daughters were shot on Thursday
I cant find them
Theres no one left
Many escaped across the border to neighboring Bangladesh which has allowed the Rohingya in for humanitarian reasons
Now almost 1 million Rohingya refugees live in a camp outside a town called Coxs Bazar
It is considered the largest refugee camp in the world and this is where our story is centered on today
The virus hit the camp in late March and as of now they officially have a little over 30 cases and three deaths
I know that must not sound like a lot to countries that have seen thousands even tens of thousands of deaths
But we have to realize the unique situation that this camp and a lot of other refugee camps are facing
So now its too crowded so people cant maintain the social distancing
I spoke to Mohammad Arafat a young Rohingya filmmaker and activist who lives inside the camp
As Mohammad says social distancing is nearly impossible
Ive been to the camp myself back in 2017
It is overcrowded and packed with makeshift homes with a population density that is four times that of New York City
Families also share toilets and handwashing facilities
We are told to wash our hands multiple times a day thats not really possible for the refugees
So now we cant go anywhere
We are staying inside the home
We can call each other otherwise most of the time we cant communicateOn top of all this theres an internet ban in the camp
The Bangladeshi government did this last year because they said that extremists were using the internet to organize
Without internet its extremely hard to get any information what the virus is its symptoms how you can prevent it
Aid groups like the UNHCR United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees the UN refugee agency are sending people text messages while the Red Cross has told me that they have volunteers going door to door
In order to try to get ahead of the virus the camp has been put under lockdown since March and aid groups on the ground have been preparing for the pandemic to hit
The great fear is that this ravages the local population that it runs riot
I spoke to David Miliband the CEO of the International Rescue Committee a global humanitarian charity that works with communities affected by conflict and disaster
Theres very little testing going on
Theres been 400 tests only for the million people there
Whereas remember countries like the US or Germany are testing 40000 people per million of populationAnd our focus as a humanitarian aid agency is obviously on treating people who have got the disease but is also building isolation centers so they dont affect the rest of the population
We built two 50 to 60 bed isolation centers
But also critically the work on prevention the handwashing the information campaigns the fever testing to try to separate the population out
And in terms of if someone does get sick with the virus tell us what happens to them
Do they get treated inside the camp or are they taken elsewhere
Yes there is basic primary care that we provide and other nongovernmental organizations other NGOs provide
Obviously for the most severe cases they get referred
But I dont want to give the impression that services are anything like what you might expect in a much richer advanced industrialized country
And so its desperately important that people get treated before it gets too serious
I mean once you need a ventilator its too late really
And the great fear is that despite the large amount of asymptomatic cases for a population that has had such a traumatic few years that for too many it will be too difficult to save them
In terms of the the cases you know obviously its quite low at the moment
But as youve said the testing is not really there
How bad could it get there
What are your concerns in terms of that
Its worth saying that the disease which has followed a very clear curve in Europe and North America and Latin America the great fear and the great likelihood Im afraid is it follows the same trajectory in South Asia in Bangladesh in Afghanistan and Pakistan where we work and also across swaths of Africa
And since this is a disease of the connected world it needs a far more effective standing up of global health support than governments have so far managed
Theyve been preoccupied understandably with taking care of their own citizens
No one says the government isnt firstly responsible for their own citizens
But its myopic not to treat the global nature of this as of absolutely integral importance
And in terms of refugees in particular you know that this coronavirus is affecting towns and cities around the world you know as youve mentioned people are very focused on whats happening close to home
So why should people care about refugees in particular
Well I think that we should care about the worlds most vulnerable for two reasons
Theres a moral reason which I dont think we should run away from
Human beings who cant care for themselves deserve support
But I think theres also a strategic reason
When youve got a disease of the connected world then youre only as strong as the weakest link in the chain
And there wont be a return to economic normality of a global kind until the disease is tackled everywhere
And so there are large countries like Nigeria which is hosting refugees from Cameroon
There are countries across the Middle East obviously that have got refugees from Syria
So in every continent there youve got refugees from Venezuela and Colombia
And the argument has to be that theres only two or three degrees of separation before the business person from New York wants to be on a flight back to Dubai
And in Dubai theyre meeting with people from Lebanon or Jordan whove been in touch with people in Syria and in Syria weve got no testing going on
So you can see the that is not many degrees of separation before you understand that unless this disease is tackled everywhere then theres going to be danger everywhere
In terms of what we can do to help refugees
What can individuals doWell Id love individuals to visit our website
I would love them to understand some of the stories of the people who we are helping because they are the daily reminder that its people like you or me
I mean refugees in Syria are people who were accountants they were fitness trainers they were journalists they were bakers they were farmers
And so Id love them to do that
If theyre running a business Id love to give Id love them to give the refugees in their country a chance to work because people who have known the price of oppression also know the value of freedom
And obviously if people are able I want them to support charities like the International Rescue Committee
And so those are people who need support and they need support for moral reasons
But also if you want to see the world get back to normal then we need to take on these global health challenges together
I know I say that were all in this together a lot but I genuinely believe that
And theres nothing that illustrates this better than what Bex just talked about
There are people listening to this podcast that could be half a world away from a refugee camp in Bangladesh but this virus has proven that were all interconnected
We cant all truly be free of a global pandemic unless the entire world is safe as well
Well be back tomorrow
Thanks for listening

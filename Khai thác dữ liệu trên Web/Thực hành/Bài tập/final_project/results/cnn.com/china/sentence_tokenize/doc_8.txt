The law is simply plugging a loophole they claimed and is no different to what many other countries have on the books
Local officials and prominent businesses threw their weight behind the bill sight unseen promising that it would leave the city better off and in any case
On Saturday Chinas National Peoples Congress NPC which is expected to pass the law in coming weeks gave Hong Kong its first glimpse of what it contains
as drafted the law appears to upend the citys prized independent legal system allowing Beijing to override local laws while enhancing its ability to suppress political opposition
Most controversially the law gives Beijing the power to exercise jurisdiction over select criminal cases raising the prospect that for the first time in Hong Kongs history suspects could be extradited across the border to face trial and potentially prison time in the mainland
Fears of just that were what drove protests against an extradition bill last year that was proposed by the Hong Kong government
Those protests eventually forced the abandonment of that law but spiraled into broader antigovernment unrest that Beijing says required the imposition of the new national security regulations
a lawyer and political analyst based in Hong Kong described the new law as a broadbased power grab by Beijing over many of the key elements of government and societyWriting on Twitter he said the new law effectively sets up a parallel judiciary and takes interpretation and final adjudication power away from Hong Kong courts
In a statement the citys chief executive Carrie Lam said the law would ensure the longterm prosperity and stability of Hong Kong reiterated that it would only target an extremely small minority of people and said the proposed bill was in line with the rule of law and the rights and freedoms which are applicable in Hong Kong under the Basic Law and relevant international covenants
When Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997 the citys common law system remained largely intact
Precedent remained in force and protections under the new de facto constitution Basic Law as well as various international treaties guaranteed a degree of fairness and freedom not seen in China where the conviction rate is north of 90
While the NPC did gain the ability to interpret Basic Law the central government did not have any jurisdiction over individual cases nor could people be tried for crimes against Beijing that were not illegal in Hong Kong
The new national security law would change all of that
According to details published over the weekend Chinese security organs will have the power to exercise jurisdiction over national security cases under specific circumstances while other prosecutions under the law will be heard by a panel of judges picked by the citys Beijingappointed leader
It does not say explicitly whether suspects could face extradition to mainland China under such circumstancesThough the draft did make reference to upholding the rule of law and various civil liberties it also subordinates existing law to the national security bill so that where there is a conflict the national security law prevails
In practice this could mean that when a national security prosecution contravenes human rights protected under Hong Kong law those rights are suspended
Writing after the Saturday announcement Jerome Cohen an expert on Chinese law the eye candy on human rights pointing out that the very provisions in the draft law would appear to violate those protections
The Handover has clearly become the Takeover Cohen added
Kevin Yam a Hong Kongbased solicitor and former convenor of the Progressive Lawyers Group the proposed law was not worth legal interpretation adding theres nothing to analyze
Its just whatever they say it is he added
And if they cannot make it whatever they say it is when they want something they will just change it in whatever way they like
While there has been no suggestion of a true public consultation or referendum on the bill multiple provisions revealed Saturday appeared geared towards or at least easing its selling to the public
Such provisions come amid a massive propaganda effort to sell the bill with posters and adverts promoting it plastering Hong Kong as well as an apparent push by Beijing for Chinese firms to relist on the citys stock exchange boosting the local economy
In particular the creation of a panel nominated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam to hear national security cases may have been a sop to those who were expressing alarm at reports the bill would bar foreignborn judges from hearing them
As part of the wider common law system which also includes the UK Canada Australia and a number of other jurisdictions Hong Kong periodically appoints to the Court of Final Appeal
These judges are appointed by the chief executive but their presence in certain cases has been controversial in China leading to calls for their removal or barring them from certain sensitive cases
By giving Lam the power to nominate judges to hear national security cases the government essentially sidesteps this issue enabling her to choose those judges deemed most loyal
The Hong Kong Bar Association has the plans as extraordinary and a major blow to judicial independence pointing out that Lam will be appointing a panel to oversee cases in which she herself is an interested party
Bar Association head Philip Dykes said the law was a recipe for conflict of interest and would allow Lam to cherrypick which judges heard the most controversial casesAlvin Yeung an opposition lawmaker and barrister the proposal was a clear departure from common law traditions
Expanding the power of Chinese courts and security services to Hong Kong carries with it even more concerns
Permitting Chinas security apparatus to operate in the city raises the specter of extralegal persecution
Dissidents and activists in China are often disappeared by the authorities or threatened with arrest around sensitive events and many journalists and lawyers are dragged in to take tea with the security services during which they receive thinlyveiled threats about the potential consequences of their workGiving Chinese courts jurisdiction under specific circumstances meanwhile will likely guarantee convictions in those cases
Chinas legal system has been widely criticized for its lack of human rights protections nakedly political prosecutions and a nearly universal conviction rate
The countrys own national security law has been interpreted broadly in the past to imprison activists intellectuals and journalists
Two Canadians
Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in late 2018 shortly after the detention in Canada of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou
While China argues there is solid evidence against the two men Canada views the case as arbitrary and politicallymotivated
Kovrig and Spavor are also an example of how national security legislation in China differs to that in democratic countries
Canada for example has espionage and spying and people have been prosecuted under them
The difference is that those laws and the corresponding prosecutions must conform to the the countrys bill of rights and could be struck down were they found by a court to be unconstitutional
This is not the case in China and may soon not be the case in Hong Kong if the proposal for the law goes ahead
While China does mention certain rights in its these are subordinate to the law not overriding
Freedom of expression religion and the press exist but may not infringe upon the interests of the State
Similarly Hong Kong guarantees rights under Basic Law and through being a signatory to international conventions but the national security law as drafted would override these protections
Those who attempt to assert their constitutionallyprotected rights in China are often prosecuted on the grounds of national security such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo on charges of inciting subversion of state power

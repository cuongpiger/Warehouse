Few would deny that Beijings national security law which allows Beijing to define for the territory which acts are secession subversion terrorism or interference by foreign forces opens the way for troubling restrictions on the civil liberties of Hong Kong citizens
But once again President Trump has chosen a dramatic but doomed policy that will do little harm to China while further isolating the US from its allies
Like his ongoing trade war Trumps Hong Kong policy on China with little concern for its effectiveness or cost to American interests
Since 1997 US recognition of Hong Kong as autonomous from China has allowed for development of a deep USHong Kong trade relationship
Removing the citys special trade status will highlight the presidents power to withhold favor but walking away from Hong Kong does little to pressure China to maintain the citys autonomy under the one country two systems policyRemoval of Hong Kongs special customs status is toothless and more symbolic than of real consequence for the mainland
As a separate member of the World Trade Organization Hong Kongs exports to the United States have enjoyed most favored nation status subject only to tariffs offered to every other member
Revoking the citys special status will subject its exports to the high tariffs the president levied against China during his ongoing trade war
But this change will barely budge the status quo
Thats because Hong Kongs economy consists mostly of financial logistical and other services not manufactured goods
As Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics of the 45 billion in Hong Kong exports to the United States only 1 is actually produced in Hong Kong and eligible for low tariff rates
Most of Hong Kongs exports to the United States are goods produced in China that are reexported through Hong Kong and already subject to the same high tariffs as the goods China exports directly
Hong Kong and American interests not Beijing will be the main victims of Trumps decision to walk away from the special relationship
Bilateral free currency exchange preferential customs treatment and visafree travel have made Hong Kong a center for American commerce in the region
In 2018 US foreign investment in Hong Kong totaled
More than 1300 US companies operate in the city of which an estimated
The city is an important market for US exports of meat and agricultural products
In 2019 the US trade surplus in goods with Hong Kong was the highest among its trading partners
By revoking Hong Kongs special status the president risks abandoning US businesses based in the city
Along with higher tariffs on goods they ship back to the United States these businesses may in time be subject to stricter controls on access and use of American technology
American business travelers may lose visafree access to the city a possible retaliatory response by Beijing to the removal of Hong Kongs special status
Perhaps most importantly a failure to maintain Hong Kongs special status represents a missed opportunity to pressure China as it contemplates stricter control over the tax regulatory and legal systems to which American businesses are subjectTrumps tariffs have produced little change in Chinese practices while
Their wide coverage and high rates have left him little maneuvering room
After unleashing a litany of complaints against China during a June 5 visit to coastal Maine Trump said he would tariff Its very hard to see what he has in mind since the few goods on which the United States has not already levied tariffs are precious to the United States as well as China
Tariffs teed up for late last year and then suspended with the signing of his Phase 1 deal products designed and marketed by American companies and a significant source of US jobs and profits
Withdrawing the United States from international organizations is another way that Trump has hurt American interests while displaying his displeasure with China
Under his watch the United States has the World Trade Organization by refusing to approve new judges for its appellate body in part for rulings he views as weak on China
Most recently Trump the end of US support for the World Health Organization citing his view that it had failed to properly confront Chinas role in the coronavirus pandemic
Withdrawal from these arenas from Hong Kong to Geneva leaves US allies in limbo reluctant to follow Washingtons lead and unwilling to disengage from China
Walking away from situations that challenge US interests as Trump has done with Hong Kong only to hide behind a wall of ever higher barriers will only serve to leave China unchecked and America increasingly alone

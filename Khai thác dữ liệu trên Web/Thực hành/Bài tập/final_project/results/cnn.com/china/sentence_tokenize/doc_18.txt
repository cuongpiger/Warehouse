Yuriko Koike said the Games could signify a victory over the pandemic adding that more work is still to be done to improve treatment and testing but admitted that organizers were contending with a number of uncertaintiesThe Olympics were originally scheduled to begin in July but to July 23 next year amid the Covid19 outbreak
The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are an important event that everyone has been waiting for Koike told CNNs Will Ripley
The postponement cost a lot and more than anything we do not know what the coronavirus situation will be like in July next year
We have a few uncertainties here
It costs a lot to begin with we need understanding from the people of Tokyo for it
We must not spend too much
We have to make the Games safe for athletes and spectators
Organizers said in December that the cost of hosting the Olympics was some while sponsors insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the GamesThere have been 17039 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Japan and 917 deaths according to the latest tally from Johns Hopkins University JHU
Since the postponement of the Olympics was announced there is no plan to delay the Games again
We have to identify the specifics of the virus develop the curing medicine improve the testing facilities said Koike
But we cannot afford to let the battle against the coronavirus last for 10 or 20 years
The global community must have a clear goal to win over the coronavirus and compete for solutions by making a safe society and sharing successful examples of battling the virus
I wish the success of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics as a sign of humanitys victory over the coronavirus
Despite its high population density Tokyo has weathered the virus well recording 5347 confirmed cases and 307 deaths according to JHU
That is all thanks to cooperation by the people of Tokyo said Koike
Wearing masks has become an ordinary custom for the Japanese since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918
The sense of hygiene of the Japanese people was superb and that helped to suppress the number of deaths compared to western countries

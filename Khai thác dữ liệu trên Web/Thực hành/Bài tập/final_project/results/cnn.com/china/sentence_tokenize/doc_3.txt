Its a phrase that is now used widely in Chinese staterun media as well as Western publications and it was made clear last weekend that its proponents have the full support of the countrys top diplomatSpeaking at a press conference in Beijing Sunday Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China would now push back against deliberate insults
We never pick a fight or bully others
But we have principles and guts
We will push back against any deliberate insult resolutely defend our national honor and dignity and we will refute all groundless slander with facts said Wang responding to a question from CNNBut what is wolf warrior diplomacy what does the name mean and where did it originate
The wolf warriors represent a completely different type of diplomat to the famously bland Chinese foreign representatives of the past few decadesInstead of long verbose statements these Chinese officials are taking to Twitter and other social media platforms to hit back directly at any criticism of China or the ruling Communist Party
Wolf Warrior is actually the title of a hugelysuccessful series of patriotic action films in China featuring Rambolike protagonists who fight enemies at home and abroad to defend Chinese interests
The first film was released in 2015 and made at the box officeIt quickly spawned a sequel that became Chinas highest grossing film at the time when it was released in 2017
Wolf Warrior 2 was based around a squad of Peoples Liberation Army soldiers sent into an African country to rescue Chinese civilians
The films tagline was Even though a thousand miles away anyone who affronts China will pay
An early comparison between the film series and Chinas diplomats came in July 2019 when Zhao Lijian then a counselor at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan began to hit back hard against the US government on TwitterIn a controversial series of tweets Zhao claimed the US had no right to criticize China on human rights abuses when it had problems with racism income inequality and gun violence
Zhao alleged there were places in Washington DC where It provoked a furious reaction from former US President Barack Obamas National Security Adviser Susan Rice who called Zhao a racist disgrace
But one year later Zhaos career has only blossomed and he is now one of the three highprofile spokespeople who hold the Chinese Foreign Ministrys daily press conferenceNot only that but Chinese diplomats across the world have begun to mirror Zhaos aggressive tactics on Twitter a platform long banned in ChinaZhaos boss Hua Chunying director general of the Foreign Ministrys Department of Information has frequently lashed out at critics on her Twitter account which she only opened in October 2019 and now boasts almost 500000 followers
Some politicians ignore the basic facts and make up countless lies and conspiracy theories concerning China Hua said on May 24 between the US and China over the coronavirus pandemicChinas ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming has been another keen wolf warrior regularly using Twitter to hit back against critics of Beijing in EuropeSpeaking to state media on Monday Liu said that the term wolf warrior was a misunderstanding of Chinas foreign policy which he said was an independent foreign policy of peace but added sometimes a strong hand was needed
Where there is a wolf there is a warrior Liu said in an answer Despite the comments by Foreign Minister Wang and the ambassador there still appears to be a degree of indecision in the Chinese government and state media over whether or not to fully embrace the termIn April the staterun tabloid Global Times published a story praising Chinas wolf warrior diplomats for taking the fight to the West saying it was necessary as Western diplomats resort to But one month later on May 24 following Foreign Minister Wangs comments the tabloids editorial claimed it was the US who was actually running a wolf warrior foreign policy
Labeling Chinese diplomacy as wolf warrior reflects an extreme ideology the paper saidRichard McGregor an expert in the Chinese Communist Party and senior fellow at the Lowy Institute said that there was currently a fierce debate inside China over how aggressive the countrys foreign policy should be
Theres clearly a split about how China should conduct its diplomacy
It might only be a tactical split but at the moment the wolves seem to have the ascendancy he said
Im not sure that will last

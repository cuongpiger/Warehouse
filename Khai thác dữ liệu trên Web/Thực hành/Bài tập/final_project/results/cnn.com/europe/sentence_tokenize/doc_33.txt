But critics say that instead of tackling the crisis headon perhaps with a reshuffle of his ministerial team a shakeup of government policy or the announcement of an inquiry Prime Minister Boris Johnson has engaged in a tactic of an altogether more Trumpian style
He has launched a culture war
The lead story in Britains heavyweight newspaper last weekend was a leak of a plan to block measures that would have made it easier for trans people to change the gender on their birth certificateAs protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement swept across the UK the Prime Minister condemned the violent removal of a statue of a slave owner and portrayed the daubing of graffiti on a memorial to an effort to photoshop the entire cultural landscape
And while his government struggles in the face of the onslaught of Covid19 Johnson announced the merger of two big government departments the Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO which oversees the UK governments foreign policy and the Department for International Development DFID which runs aid policy
The purpose To fulfil a policy aim favored by the conservative right that foreign aid should be tied to the UK national interest
Johnsons government is sitting on a thumping 80seat majority
It could do anything it wants
Yet experts say the Prime Minister a former journalist who is an instinctive campaigner appears to be indulging in what amounts to a reelection effort four years before the date of the next poll
The mystery is why
His reflex is to go back to newspaper commentary and to write columns on statues to seed stories in the press about trans issues because thats a way of mobilizing his own base and to throw a hornets nest at his opponents Robert Saunders a British political history expert at Queen Mary University of London told CNNThat base is considerably larger than it used to be and includes many voters in areas that were formerly strongholds of the opposition Labour Party like the former industrial towns of the English Midlands Wales and northwest England
Many of those voters were drawn to Johnson by his straightforward electoral promise to get Brexit done
That promise was fulfilled when Britain officially left the European Union at the end of March and the debate switched from an ideological in or out battle to the practicalities of trade and fishing rights
With Brexit largely resolved in the minds of the electorate the Conservatives might be seeking a new way to reinforce the impression that the Labour Party only stands for liberal educated young people and does not really have a sense of what is going on in middle England said Tim Bale a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of LondonBy stoking the divisions that emerged from Brexit the Prime Ministers team are hoping to keep the flame of polarization alive by generating other issues that are likely to trigger the same adversarial feelings he addedInflaming the opinion of social conservatives is a skill set Johnson nurtured as a journalist
In the 90s as the Daily Telegraphs Brussels correspondent he made a name for himself with bombastic articles that portrayed the EU as a regulatory nightmare according to British journalist Tom Baldwin From misleading stories about attempts to ban bendy bananas andJohnsons coverage along with that of other rightwing newspapers contributed to a growing euroskeptic British media environmentHis stint as the proimmigrant London mayor between 20082016 made him a household name but he downplayed that social liberalism as he took aim for 10 Downing Street
By the time the 2016 Brexit referendum came around Johnsons jingoism was on steroids
The former London mayor by now a Conservative MP energetically spearheaded a cynically populist and xenophobic leave campaign
Targets included the EU and even US President Barack Obama at whom Johnson lashed out for opposing Britains exit from the EU
In a column in the Sun newspaper Johnson a bust of wartime leader Winston Churchill from the Oval Office because of the partKenyan Presidents ancestral dislike of the British empire
Johnsons dogwhistling added to the straightforward narrative of an island nation under siege an effective distraction from more prosaic concerns like access to the single market
A culture war is fundamentally about distraction Saunders added
Youre trying to distract your opponent from issues that you dont want to talk about and move them onto issues that you do
Johnsons campaign of course worked
Britain voted narrowly to leave the EU in June 2016
After being voted in last July as new Conservative leader and Prime Minister
His administration stacked with yesmen has however struggled to shake off its campaigning mindset
Culture war issues are not just an instrumental technique to shore up the base and expand it Bale added
Some people around Johnson literally believe this stuff and do think traditional British values are under threat from a cancel culture which they think is inimical to the traditions of this country
Johnsons rhetoric has come back to haunt him as Black Lives Matter protests in the UK have turned into a fuller discussion on racial injustice and structural racism in Britain
The Conservative party was in their crosshairs out Johnsons habit of using racist language in his past columns of flagwaving piccaninnies an offensive term used to describe black children
Johnson apologized for the comments in 2008
In 2018 to letterboxes and the Muslim women who wore them as bank robbers
The Prime Minister has struggled to address the concerns of protesters flipflopping between empathy and denial while US President Donald Trump for his response to the US protests
After stating Black Lives Matter in a statement published in the afroCaribbean newspaper Johnson issued against the removal of statues saying protests had been hijacked by extremists after a statue of Churchill of whom Johnson wrote a biography was defaced with the words was a racist
He continued to equate the antiracism protesters with violence and declaim the sanctity of the now boardedup Churchill statue in a on Sunday
He reserved one paragraph to condemn the patently racist farright groups with police officers last Saturday as they targeted Black Lives Matter demonstrationsJohnson announced the launch of a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities which will also examine why white workingclass boys fell behind in school
Downing Street policy chief Munira Mirza has reportedly been tasked with helping to set up it upBut in the last five years there have been reviews into in the UK which have included around 200 recommendations addressing deaths in custody the criminal justice system and the Theres no need for another inquiry say especially one in which a leading role is played by Mirza who wrote in a 2017 article that an antiracism lobby was peddling a culture of grievance
The Prime Minister defended his aide in Parliament on Wednesday saying he was a huge admirer of Mirza as she is brilliant thinker about these issues
Instead critics say the government would do well to enact the recommendations of those previous reviews
Implement them thats what Boris has to do
And then the Black Lives Matter protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with coronavirus said the author of opposition Labour MP David Lammy who used a article to accuse Johnson of starting a culture war as a distraction from the governments handling of racial inequalityJohnson said the new commission would learn very fast what changes needed to be made according to PA news agency
As the last four years have shown minority groups have been easy targets in populist upheavals
Official statistics from show that hate crime increased during and immediately after the EU referendumTimes journalist Rachel SylvesterNumber 10 has been polling culture war issues such as transgender rights to see whether they can be weaponized against Labour in northern workingclass constituencies
That came to fruition last week after JK Rowling post that linked her opposition to trans women using singlesex spaces to her past experience of domestic abuse
Later the Sunday Times said the leaked plan included upcoming rules to stop singlesex female spaces like toilets from being used by those with male anatomy
The Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss in April that by the summer she would be putting in place the protection of singlesex spaces which is extremely important
While not commenting or disputing the Sunday Times article a Number 10 spokesperson said it shared the position of the Government Equalities Office led by Truss
Johnson is a pound shop Trump slightly more acceptable and less utterly crass Christine Burns a trans campaigner and author of Trans Britain Our Journey from the Shadows told CNN
Just as Brexit emboldened people to be racist to roll back on transgender rights at such a febrile moment is not just emboldening people to be transphobic in their language but also to use physical force she warnedThe axing of the Department for International Development DFiD demonstrated Downing Streets preference for ideology over capacity according to David Hudson Professor of Politics and Development at the University of Birmingham
It is somewhat astonishing that it has happened right now in a middle of a pandemic when the government and civil service are massively stretched Hudson told CNN
The merger criticized by three former Prime Ministers would lead to less transparency on how aid is spent and risks diluting DFIDs poverty alleviation agenda he said
Johnson defended the move on Tuesday saying for too long frankly UK overseas aid has been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests or to the values that the UK
Johnson has also refused to countenance an extension to the Brexit transition period despiteinsisting that that Britain needs more time to negotiate a trade deal especially in a pandemic
All this is happening as the government is struggling to convince the public that its strategy to handle the coronavirus outbreak has been worldbeating according to Johnson whose pledged for June has been beset with problems
The UKs longdelayed attempt to build a homegrown was abandoned on Thursday in favor of joining efforts led by Apple and GoogleWill Johnson focus on governing rather than rule via press release as Britains economy nosedives the country faces appalling levels of unemployment and probably further waves of the pandemic
Saunders askedThere are one of two routes the UK could go he added
The publics patience for these stunts might diminish and Johnson focusses on talking about jobs employment and health policy he said
Or the stunts are going to have to become nastier and more divisive to hold the publics attention

Its impossible to overstate how important it is for Prime Minister Boris Johnson that this goes well after a
His response has been attacked across the political spectrum as has his handling of recent Black Lives Matter protests across the country with critics accusing Johnson of using language that enflames racial division leading ultimately to ugly scenes as farright extremist groups took part in violent counterprotests at the weekend
So from the governments perspective this easing of lockdown must not end in disaster
The worstcase scenario is that unlocking leads to a second wave of coronavirus infections resulting in more deaths and the country being locked down again
It will be very hard to sell this to a public which despite largely obeying measures since March has the highest death rate in Europe
I dont think its too much to say that his survival as Prime Minister is in danger if we get a second spike says Tim Bale professor of politics at Queen Mary University
Im not sure he could restore public confidence in his government if anything like a return to the lockdown had to be executed
The government really has to get this right and pray its not too early as some people claim it may be
These claims that lockdown is being lifted too soon range from the editorial pages of the leftleaning Guardian newspaper which believes Johnson is seeing polls not science and gambling with the health of the nation to scientists advising the government who have called it a political decision
So given the risk of it going wrong why unlock now
The answer might lie in those opinion polls the Guardian is talking about
I cannot remember a drop in trust for a British government occurring quite so rapidly says Bale
A narrative has developed that Johnson and his government have made a series of mistakes that have led to more deaths than there really should have been
They will be hoping that opening up the country and economy again might shift that narrative especially as the daily death toll drops
Such a distraction would probably be welcomeLast week the government had to abandon its hopes to have primary schools return before the summer holidays after it became clear that many schools could not safely have pupils return
Johnsons opposite number Labour leader Keir Starmer pointed out that the country is now in a ridiculous situation where next week betting shops and theme parks will be open but parents are not clear when their children will go back to school
To critics its simply the latest example of this governments incompetence in handling a major public health crisis
And those criticisms are not baseless
The UK went into lockdown later than many other European nations a decision that Neil Ferguson an epidemiologist and former government adviser admitted last week was perilous Had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half
And the governments core strategy to protect the national health service and by public health experts who believe it has led to thousands of unnecessary deaths in the community
The government decided to create capacity in the NHS by sending elderly and invariably frail and vulnerable people to nursing homes
Some of them were infected with the virus
This introduced infection into homes and led to the staggering number of excess deaths says Bharat Pankhania a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical SchoolPankhania is one of many public health experts who believes that the easing of restrictions as of Monday is premature and may cost more lives and makes a second peak almost inevitable
Our poor record on extensive and universal testing means that we cant say with precision how many cases there are in the community
The governments new testandtrace system is too centralized and in my opinion not nimble enough to pick up the true picture of infection he adds
The centralized testandtrace operations eventually appeared five months after the UKs first confirmed case of the virusAs if one crisis wasnt enough Britains pandemic has dovetailed with the other big story of the moment the global response to the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in the United States and the anger from black and ethnic minority communities at inequality and institutionalized racismEarlier this month the government released a report detailing how
The demonstrations that took place were about more than both George Floyd and the virus
Although Floyd was a trigger the protests were as much about institutional racism and deaths of black people in police custody in the UK says Diane Abbott a highprofile opposition Labour MP
The whole atmosphere has been enflamed by the terrible black death toll from Covid which has left the community feeling under siege
She along with many others has found the governments response to be underwhelming
Johnson and others in the government said that the protests had been subverted by thuggery
This sort of language does have consequences
The word thug plays into a stereotype of aggressive young black men says Kehinde Andrews professor of Black Studies at the UKs Birmingham City University
When you look at why black people are so much more likely to be arrested or suffer violence it often comes back to this stereotype
On Friday the Prime Minister sent a condemning those who wanted to graffiti or bring down the statue of Winston Churchill which stands outside Parliament
The following day farright protesters took to the streets of London with the aim some said of protecting this statue from damage leading to violent clashes with antiracism protesters and police
Both the Prime Minister and his Home Secretary seemed more occupied about statues of slave traders being toppled than the death toll from the Atlantic slave trade says AbbottSo this easing of lockdown comes at a time when Johnson is fighting on several fronts
Johnson loyalists are worried that his inner circle is not adequately prepared for what happens if things start to go wrong
A lot of us are worried that the top team havent seemed surefooted lately said one government minister who was not authorized to speak on the record
If this goes well then in the long run people might be relieved that we opened up the country and the economy and this could be remembered as a success
But we cannot afford to make as many mistakes we have in recent weeks
There is a lot of confusion and annoyance out there
Another Conservative MP who requested not to be named for risk of undermining parliamentary work said Johnson is a leader not a micromanager
His political capital is in getting the big things right like solving the Brexit crisis last year
There is a lot of anger out there and if things go wrong the finger will point to the Prime Minister
The worry among many Conservatives is that this government has been accidentprone lately from creating avoidable scandals such as Johnsons chief aide Dominic Cummings to being forced into policy reversals
No one doubts this is a very challenging time for any government says Iain Duncan Smith a former leader of the Conservative Party
So many things are happening which are difficult to control because they are unprecedented
Yet when things you do control have setbacks because of poor planning the risk is that the government looks weak which sets a dangerous narrative about competence
However while many Conservatives are worried about this competence narrative others are optimistic that if the lockdown is lifted successfully then Johnson will reap the rewards
To some extent we will ultimately be judged more on the recovery from the pandemic than what is happening right now on all fronts said the government minister
Yes people are frustrated but deep down they know why its harder to open a school than a zoo
Johnson still has a long way to go before the year is out
The lives and many jobs that have been lost to this virus will not come back
The impact it has had on BAME citizens cannot be reversed
The anger that many black Britons feel wont go away without a serious examination of inequalities in British societyAll of this stuff will need addressing in some way this year regardless of a possible second peak
Which doesnt bode well given how much of the UKs political discourse has been sucked up by the single issue of Brexit for nearly four yearsAnd in the unlikely event that Johnson has forgotten he has until December 31 to fix his current Brexit headache
If he doesnt will collide with the economic crisis of a nodeal Brexit
Should that happen Johnson might be forgiven for looking back wistfully at his December 2019 landslide victory and cursing the difference that a year can make in politics

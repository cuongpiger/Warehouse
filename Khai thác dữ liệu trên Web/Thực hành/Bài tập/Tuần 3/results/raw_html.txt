The French government has decided to limit the deployment of telecom equipment belonging to the Chinese group, Huawei. Westerners suspect Huawei of using it\u2019s position in the global market for espionage purposes. In the USA, Huawei is targeted by more than 20 counts.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"swiggy\">Swiggy <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said on Monday it is cutting 1,100 jobs and scaling down some adjacent businesses as India\u2019s top food delivery startup looks to reduce costs to survive the coronavirus pandemic that has made people cautious about ordering food online.<\/p>\n<p>In an internal email, which the Bangalore-headquartered startup <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.swiggy.com\/news-updates\/changes-were-making-to-adapt-to-the-times\">published<\/a> on its blog, Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety said the startup\u2019s core food business had been \u2018severely impacted.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The startup, which employed about 8,000 people late last year, is currently processing fewer than a million orders a day on its platform, down from nearly 3 million it was handling before the outbreak, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To cut costs, Swiggy said it would be eliminating 1,100 jobs \u201cacross grades and functions in the cities and head office&#8221; over the next few days. The company, backed by Prosus Ventures, said it will provide those affected with three months of salary, with one additional month for each year they have spent at the startup.<\/p>\n<p>It will also provide those being let go with medical and accident coverage until the end of the year, and counseling for mental, emotional, and financial stress throughout the same period.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is easily the hardest and longest deliberated decision the management team and I have been faced with over recent times. We have been fortunate to have some of the brightest missionary talent in the country join us over the last few years, and I would like to state unequivocally that this is not at all a reflection of anyone\u2019s performance,\u201d wrote Majety.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch, as well as Indian newspaper Economic Times and outlet Entrackr, reported in late April that the startup was<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/21\/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-is-cutting-jobs\/\"> cutting about 1,000 jobs<\/a>, mostly in the cloud kitchen category. Swiggy had confirmed the layoff at the time, but did not share a number.<\/p>\n<p>A Swiggy spokesperson did not immediately share whether today\u2019s announcement represents the same job cuts. A person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch today that Monday&#8217;s 1,100 job cuts primarily affect those in non-cloud kitchen parts of the business.<\/p>\n<p>Monday\u2019s announcement follows a similar move by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zomato\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zomato\">Zomato, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the No. 2 food delivery startup in India which said last week it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-cuts-13-of-workforce\/\">reducing its global workforce by 13%, or about 520 people<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Swiggy&#8217;s Majety said the company was &#8220;choosing to scale down or shut down\u00a0adjacent businesses that are either going to be highly volatile or will not be highly relevant for the next 18 months.&#8221; One of those businesses is cloud kitchens &#8212; an area Swiggy has focused on for more than two years, and seemingly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/19\/swiggy-cloud-kitchen-india\/\">doubled down just last quarter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Late last year, Swiggy executives said they had established 1,000 cloud kitchens for its restaurant partners in the country \u2014 more than any of its local rivals. The startup said it had invested in more than a million square feet of real estate space across 14 cities in the country in the last two years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Since the onset of Covid, we have already begun the process of shutting down our kitchen facilities temporarily or permanently, depending on their outlook and profitability profile. We are already operating at significantly lower levels on our staffing and physical infra than our earlier footprint, and will continue to optimize before we get more clarity on order volumes for food delivery,&#8221; wrote Majety.<\/p>\n<p>Swiggy and Zomato, that have formed duopoly in India&#8217;s food delivery business, are currently in talks to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/06\/indias-swiggy-raises-43m-to-expand-to-new-businesses\/\">raise additional capital<\/a> as part of their ongoing financing rounds. In recent weeks they have also started to deliver grocery items to spur demand.<\/p>\n<p>Several industries, especially travel and hospitality, have also been severely hit as people follow the New Delhi&#8217;s stay-at-home order. Oyo, a startup valued at $10 billion, said last month it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/08\/indias-oyo-furloughs-thousands-of-employees-as-revenue-drops-by-over-50\/\">placing thousands of employees on leave and furloughs for up to three months<\/a> in the U.S. and several other markets as its revenue dropped by more than 60% in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>Ixigo, a 13-year-old travel and hotel booking service, said late April it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/30\/ixigo-cuts-salary-of-every-employee-over-coronavirus\/\">cutting the salary of its entire staff.<\/a> MakeMyTrip, another travel and stay booking service, announced in the same month that it was also cutting the salary of its top management level across the company.

founder and CEO Ryan Denehy.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The funding situation with Electric is a bit unique. Electric raised a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/23\/electric-the-startup-that-automates-it-raises-25-million-from-ggv\/\">$25 million Series B round led by GGV in January of 2019<\/a>. In March of this year, just before the lockdown, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/10\/electric-reopens-series-b-to-make-room-for-dick-costolo-and-adam-bain\/\">reopened the Series B<\/a> at a higher valuation to make room for Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, raising an additional $14.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Then the coronavirus pandemic rocked the globe. On Monday March 9, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/wall-streets-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-ends-with-the-dow-down-2000\/\">stock market felt it<\/a>, triggering a temporary halt on trading. The following week was total financial chaos.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when Adam Bain called up Denehy again. They &#8216;rapped out&#8217; about the potential for Electric during this turbulent time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The increase in remote work is going to be dramatic,&#8221; said Denehy, relaying his conversation with Bain. &#8220;Larger companies are going to get smarter about budgeting and there is a lot of urgency for them to find ways to spend money around back office tasks like IT more efficiently. Electric becomes more appealing because, dollar for dollar, it&#8217;s a lot more efficient than building a big IT department.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The first week of April, Bain called Denehy again, this time saying that 01 Advisors wanted to put in more money into Electric.<\/p>\n<p>Electric is a platform designed to support the existing IT department of an organization, or in some cases, replace an outsourced IT department. Most of IT&#8217;s responsibilities focus on administration, distribution and maintenance of software programs. Electric allows IT to install its software on every corporate machine, giving the department a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the organization&#8217;s IT situation. It also aims to give IT departments more time to focus on real problem-solving and troubleshooting tasks.<\/p>\n<p>From their own machine, lead IT professionals can grant and revoke permissions, assign roles and ensure all employees&#8217; software is up to date.<\/p>\n<p>Electric is also integrated with the APIs of top software programs, like Dropbox and G-suite, letting IT handle most of their day-to-day tasks through the Electric dashboard. Moreover, Electric is also integrated with Slack, letting folks within the organization flag an issue or ask a question from the platform where they spend the most time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge for Electric is keeping up with demand,&#8221; said Jason Spinell from the Slack Fund, who also mentioned that he passed on investing in Electric&#8217;s seed round and is &#8220;excited to sort of rectify [his] mistake.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Electric also added a new self-service product that can live in the dock, letting employees look at all the software applications provided by the organization from their remote office.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are so many stretched IT departments now that have to do a lot more with a lot less,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;There are also companies who were working with an outsourced IT provider and relied on them showing up to the office a few times a week, and all of a sudden that doesn&#8217;t work anymore.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With the current ecosystem, Electric is continuing to spend on marketing but with 180 percent increase in interest from potential clients in the pipeline, according to Denehy.<\/p>\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This article has been updated to reflect the accurate amount invested by participants in the round.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Electric, a platform that aims to put IT departments in the cloud, today announced new funding following a continuation of its Series B earlier this year.

At times, I\u2019m overwhelmed by the images of countless patients on life-support and the near-endless streams of statistics regurgitating bad news.<\/p>\n<p>Having started in venture at the beginning of two recessions, I\u2019ve seen how the startup industry functions during economic trouble. My second day of work at Charles River Ventures was September 11th, 2001. My first project, analyzing the VC industry, propelled the firm to return more than 60% of its fund to investors, going from a $1.2 billion fund to $450 million. In May 2008, Mike Maples and I founded Floodgate in the midst of the Great Recession. We learned that great founders won\u2019t wait for a better economic moment to start a company.<\/p>\n<p>While we are currently embroiled in personal and professional circumstances unimaginable even three months ago, these very challenges will form the basis of incredibly innovative ideas. In order for the world to move forward, we need our greatest minds to imagine a brighter future and create solutions to make it a reality.<\/p>\n<p>When I analyze our society and novel health situation, one thing is certain: COVID-19 is a paradigm-shifting event, creating massively accelerated social and economic change.<\/p>\n<h2>The Great Reset is not just another economic event<\/h2>\n<p>Our current situation is unique. It\u2019s not merely a cyclical economic event, nor is it a standalone health crisis. What we are experiencing is not just an inflection point: it\u2019s a societal phase-change unlike anything we have ever seen. We face an epic choice of how we move forward, and the decisions we make today will shape an entire generation.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why: COVID-19 is prompting us to reset many of our most fundamental behaviors. These changes are impacting our financial system, with effects visible throughout our homes, businesses and even the concept of \u201cworkplace\u201d itself.<\/p>\n<h2>COVID-19 is pervasive<\/h2>\n<p>As a global pandemic, the virus itself has spread to nearly every country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Between February 20 and March 26, 100% of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies implemented government-mandated social distancing. Globally, the number of scheduled airline flights is down 64%. In some countries, like Spain and Germany, flight numbers are down by more than 90%.<\/p>\n<p>Since the timeline for lifting government restrictions is unclear \u2014 and even then, scientists are uncertain how the virus will spread \u2014 the question lingers: How long will this go on?<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19\u2019s impact is uncertain, long-term and potentially undulating, affecting every facet of our lives. You can\u2019t simply wait it out with the expectation that industries will rebound. In 2001, September 11 felt pervasive, but its economic impact ultimately stemmed from just one single incident and the resulting fear&#8230; and that one single incident still cost more than three trillion dollars.

I&#8217;m lucky in that my part of the city is famously packed with excellent coffee shops, but in the time I&#8217;ve lived here I&#8217;ve seen them grow increasingly packed with \u2014 well, people like me. Some days they seem more like co-working spaces than cafes \u2014 and this is something business owners and neighborhoods are going to need to acknowledge one way or the other.<\/p>\n<p>Most urban and suburban American communities were formed around the convention of commuting, which means fewer work-related resources where people live.

A<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/health-coronavirus-who-apps\/who-readies-coronavirus-app-for-checking-symptoms-possibly-contact-tracing-idUSKBN22L06L\"> WHO official told Reuters on Friday<\/a> the new app will ask people about their symptoms and offer guidance on whether they may have COVID-19. Information on testing will be personalized to the user&#8217;s country. The organization is considering adding a Bluetooth-based, contact-tracing feature, too. A version of the app will launch globally, but individual countries will be able to use the underlying technology and add features to release their own versions. Engineers from Google and Microsoft have volunteered their time over the past few weeks to develop the app, which is available open-source on GitHub.<\/li>\n<li><strong>U.S.<\/strong>: Apple&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/apple-covid-19\/id1504132184\">COVID-19 app,<\/a> developed in partnership with the CDC, FEMA and the White House, received its first major update since its March debut. The new version includes recommendations for healthcare workers to align with CDC guidelines, best practices for quarantining if you&#8217;ve been exposed to COVID-19 and new information for pregnancy and newborns.<\/li>\n<li><strong>India<\/strong>: New Delhi\u2019s contact-tracing app, Aarogya Setu, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/aarogya-setu-india-contact-tracing-app-10-crore\/\">has reached 100 million users<\/a> out of India\u2019s total 450 million smartphone owners in 41 days after its release, despite privacy concerns. The app helps users self-assess if they caught COVID-19 by answering a series of questions and will alert them if they came into contact with someone who&#8217;s infected. The app has come under fire for how it stores user location data and logs the details for those reporting symptoms. The app is required to use Indian railways, which has boosted adoption.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Iceland<\/strong>: Iceland has one of the most-downloaded contact-tracing apps, with 38% of its population using it.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/3-views-on-the-future-of-work-coffee-shops-and-neighborhoods-in-a-post-pandemic-world\/\">published a couple of different views<\/a> on the future of \u201cwork from home\u201d and remote work last Friday \u2014 a story that, if analytics is any sign, really struck a nerve with many of you.<\/p>\n<p>That shouldn\u2019t be surprising particularly in the tech industry, where knowledge work fundamentally means we spend the vast majority of our time in an \u201coffice.\u201d Everything from minor annoyances (they cut down the size of the Klondike bars in the mini-kitchen!) to massive complaints (I am trying to think through a complex ML algorithm as my open-office colleagues are having a Nerf war!) is magnified given the time we spend in these environments.<\/p>\n<p>Understandably, the mandatory Work From Home situation that many of us find ourselves in is not ideal. Schools are closed, kids are home, internet is wonky since everyone else is home, the dog sitter isn\u2019t coming and there are no caf\u00e9s to find sojourn. It\u2019s not surprising then that there is something of a popular revulsion and revolt to the whole WFH notion, even as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/twitter-says-staff-can-continue-working-from-home-permanently\/\">large tech companies like Twitter say they will permanently offer Work From Home<\/a> as an option.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HH31oXUzqK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/twitter-says-staff-can-continue-working-from-home-permanently\/\">Twitter says staff can continue working from home permanently<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Twitter says staff can continue working from home permanently&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/twitter-says-staff-can-continue-working-from-home-permanently\/embed\/#?secret=HH31oXUzqK\" data-secret=\"HH31oXUzqK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That\u2019s selling short what is really taking place though. \u201cWork From Home\u201d is terrible branding, precisely because it fails to communicate the fundamental freedom that comes with these new policies. It\u2019s not about further imprisoning us in our homes \u2014 it\u2019s about empowering us to think and work exactly where we are personally most productive.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I know that most of us are sequestered in our humble abodes due to COVID-19, but long-term, the whole point of the flexibility that \u201cWork From Home\u201d provides is precisely that you can work from <i>anywhere<\/i>. It may be your home \u2014 but it may as well be a caf\u00e9, the hospital where a sick family member is located, a beach, a friend\u2019s house, a hotel. The point of flexibility here is to untether our schedules and the stress associated with them and allow our work to happen where we want it to.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us will choose to work from home, and many of us will habitually return to the same working environment each day even if it isn\u2019t our home. That\u2019s fine. Flexibility doesn\u2019t mean constantly changing everything up \u2014 it means we can change things when we want and need to.<\/p>\n<p>One big question that has loomed over \u201cWork From Home\u201d policies is this: What if I like my office and the social life of meeting with colleagues? Again, we see the narrowness of the language. \u201cWork From Anywhere\u201d literally means <i>anywhere<\/i>, including the very office we would normally commute to.<\/p>\n<p>Flexibility means adapting our schedules and our locations for the kinds of knowledge work we are trying to do. Some days are all meetings as we try to coordinate a number of projects. Some days we need to shut out the world and just dive down into writing our novels, or developing a new algorithm, or putting together that big presentation for the all-hands meeting next week. Some days we need a mix of both. Some days we need the comfort of home, while other days we need the comfort of colleagues.<\/p>\n<p>In short, \u201cWork From Anywhere\u201d perfectly encapsulates that freedom and dynamism our schedules deserve.<\/p>\n<p>For companies, the challenge is how to empower a true Work From Anywhere culture, which is way more than the binary of \u201cin office\u201d or \u201cat home.\u201d Many companies already have expense policies that allow employees to buy key equipment for their homes (a monitor, bringing a computer home, etc.) as well as subsidizing home internet access.<\/p>\n<p>But in Work From Anywhere, should companies subsidize coffee purchases or Wi-Fi passes for employees at a nearby caf\u00e9? What about a day pass at a coworking facility? Should the company underwrite employee travel to different cities or places to freshen themselves up with new experiences? How should companies offer mechanisms for distant employees to connect in real life?<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, much of the discussion among executives today is about cost (surprise!). Offices are expensive. Office space per employee has declined over the past five decades under cost pressure, which is one reason for the forced usage of open offices compared to offices with doors that close. There is more collaboration \u2014 and a nice savings to the bottom line. Work From Home itself got more popular as broadband internet expanded and companies were looking for new ways to minimize their expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Work From Anywhere may not save a company any money whatsoever. What was once large office complexes may be a handful of smaller venues, with travel and food budgets that will more than make up for any real estate cost savings. This new workplace flexibility is not about saving money, nor long-term social distancing. In the end, it\u2019s an investment in employee well-being, productivity, and ultimately, profitability.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zPkuuIGep0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/3-views-on-the-future-of-work-coffee-shops-and-neighborhoods-in-a-post-pandemic-world\/\">3 views on the future of work, coffee shops and neighborhoods in a post-pandemic world<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;3 views on the future of work, coffee shops and neighborhoods in a post-pandemic world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/3-views-on-the-future-of-work-coffee-shops-and-neighborhoods-in-a-post-pandemic-world\/embed\/#?secret=zPkuuIGep0\" data-secret=\"zPkuuIGep0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My colleagues and I published a couple of different views on the future of \u201cwork from home\u201d and remote work last Friday \u2014 a story that, if analytics is any sign, really struck a nerve with many of you.

First, the main, long-from Equity episodes still drop every Friday, so if you are behind, check your podcast feed. Also, we&#8217;re running a listener survey which you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/whats-up-with-tiny-checks-at-giant-valuations\/\">here, in the last ep&#8217;s shownotes<\/a>.

founder and CEO Ryan Denehy.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The funding situation with Electric is a bit unique. Electric raised a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/23\/electric-the-startup-that-automates-it-raises-25-million-from-ggv\/\">$25 million Series B round led by GGV in January of 2019<\/a>. In March of this year, just before the lockdown, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/10\/electric-reopens-series-b-to-make-room-for-dick-costolo-and-adam-bain\/\">reopened the Series B<\/a> at a higher valuation to make room for Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, raising an additional $14.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Then the coronavirus pandemic rocked the globe. On Monday March 9, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/wall-streets-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-ends-with-the-dow-down-2000\/\">stock market felt it<\/a>, triggering a temporary halt on trading. The following week was total financial chaos.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when Adam Bain called up Denehy again. They &#8216;rapped out&#8217; about the potential for Electric during this turbulent time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The increase in remote work is going to be dramatic,&#8221; said Denehy, relaying his conversation with Bain. &#8220;Larger companies are going to get smarter about budgeting and there is a lot of urgency for them to find ways to spend money around back office tasks like IT more efficiently. Electric becomes more appealing because, dollar for dollar, it&#8217;s a lot more efficient than building a big IT department.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The first week of April, Bain called Denehy again, this time saying that 01 Advisors wanted to put in more money into Electric.<\/p>\n<p>Electric is a platform designed to support the existing IT department of an organization, or in some cases, replace an outsourced IT department. Most of IT&#8217;s responsibilities focus on administration, distribution and maintenance of software programs. Electric allows IT to install its software on every corporate machine, giving the department a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the organization&#8217;s IT situation.

Similarly, if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the exchange API or login system, somebody could transfer all your crypto assets to their own wallets.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>At heart, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/argent\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"argent\">Argent <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is a non-custodial Ethereum wallet, like <a href=\"https:\/\/wallet.coinbase.com\">Coinbase Wallet<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/trustwallet.com\">Trust Wallet<\/a>. You\u2019re in control of the keys. Argent can\u2019t initiate a transaction without your authorization for instance.<\/p>\n<p>But that level of control brings a lot of complexities. Hardware wallets, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ledger.com\">Ledger<\/a> wallets, ask you to write down a seed phrase so that you can recover your wallet if you lose your device. It requires some discipline and it\u2019s hard to understand if you\u2019re not familiar with the concept of seed phrases.<\/p>\n<p>Even Coinbase Wallet tells you to back up your seed phrase when you first create a wallet. \u201cWe see them as advanced tools for developers,\u201d Argent co-founder and CEO Itamar Lesuisse told me.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why a new generation of wallets tries to hide the complexity from the end user, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/16\/zengo-wants-to-become-the-crypto-wallet-for-the-masses\/\">ZenGo<\/a> and Argent. Creating a wallet on Argent is one of the best experiences in the cryptocurrency space. Your wallet is secured by something called \u2018guardians\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1989612\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png 1390w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TechCrunch-DeFi-Invest.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Trust your friends<\/h2>\n<p>A guardian can be someone you know and trust, a hardware wallet (or another phone) or a MetaMask account. Argent also provides a guardian service, which requires you to confirm your identity with a text message and an email. If you lose your phone and you want to recover your wallet on another phone, you need to speak to your guardians and get a majority of confirmations. If they can all confirm that, yes, indeed, your phone doesn\u2019t work anymore and you want to recover your crypto assets, the recovery process starts.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take an example. Here\u2019s your list of guardians:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argent\u2019s own guardian service<\/li>\n<li>Two friends who are also using Argent<\/li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.ledger.com\/products\/ledger-nano-s\">Ledger Nano S<\/a> hardware wallet<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In total, there are five different factors involved, you including. If you lose your phone, you can recover your wallet by downloading Argent on another phone (factor #1), asking Argent\u2019s guardian service to send you a text and an email to confirm your identity (factor #2) and confirming your identity with the Ledger Nano S (factor #3).<\/p>\n<p>You have reached a majority and the recovery process starts. You\u2019ll get your funds in 36 hours so that you have enough time to cancel it it\u2019s a hijacking attempt.<\/p>\n<p>But you could also have downloaded the Argent app on another phone (factor #1) and pinged your two friends (factor #2 and #3) directly. If they can confirm the same sequence of characters (emojis in that case), the recovery process would start as well.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1989615\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg 2500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/new-era-for-crypto-security-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in social recovery, multi-key schemes,\u201d Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin said <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/06\/vitalik-buterin-i-definitely-hope-centralized-exchanges-go-burn-in-hell-as-much-as-possible\/\">in a TechCrunch interview<\/a> in July 2018. It\u2019s not a new concept as social media apps already use social recovery systems. On WeChat, if you lose your password, WeChat asks you to select people in your contact list within a big list of names.<\/p>\n<p>In Argent\u2019s case, social recovery adds an element of virality as well. The experience gets better as more people around you start using Argent.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to wallet recovery, Argent uses guardians to put some limits. Just like you have some limits on your bank account, you can set a daily transaction limit to prevent attackers from grabbing all your crypto assets. You can ask your guardians to waive transactions above your daily limits.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, you can ask your guardians to lock your account for 5 days in case your phone gets stolen.<\/p>\n<h2>Betting on Ethereum<\/h2>\n<p>Argent is focused on the Ethereum blockchain and plans to support everything that Ethereum offers. Of course, you can send and receive ETH. And the startup wants to hide the complexity on this front as well as it covers transaction fees (gas) for you and gives you usernames. This way, you don\u2019t have to set the transaction fees to make sure that it\u2019ll go through.<\/p>\n<p>The startup plans to integrate DeFi projects directly in the app. DeFi stands for decentralized finance. As the name suggests, DeFi aims to bridge the gap between decentralized blockchains and financial services. It looks like traditional financial services, but everything is coded in smart contracts.<\/p>\n<p>There are dozens of DeFi projects. Some of them let you lend and borrow money \u2014 you can earn interest by locking some crypto assets in a lending pool for instance. Some of them let you exchange crypto assets in a decentralized way, with other users directly.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"icNPCXAB48\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/\">DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/embed\/#?secret=icNPCXAB48\" data-secret=\"icNPCXAB48\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Argent lets you access TokenSets, Compound, Maker DSR, Aave, Uniswap V2 Liquidity, Kyber and Pool Together.

target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"swiggy\">Swiggy <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said on Monday it is cutting 1,100 jobs and scaling down some adjacent businesses as India\u2019s top food delivery startup looks to reduce costs to survive the coronavirus pandemic that has made people cautious about ordering food online.<\/p>\n<p>In an internal email, which the Bangalore-headquartered startup <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.swiggy.com\/news-updates\/changes-were-making-to-adapt-to-the-times\">published<\/a> on its blog, Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety said the startup\u2019s core food business had been \u2018severely impacted.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The startup, which employed about 8,000 people late last year, is currently processing fewer than a million orders a day on its platform, down from nearly 3 million it was handling before the outbreak, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To cut costs, Swiggy said it would be eliminating 1,100 jobs \u201cacross grades and functions in the cities and head office&#8221; over the next few days. The company, backed by Prosus Ventures, said it will provide those affected with three months of salary, with one additional month for each year they have spent at the startup.<\/p>\n<p>It will also provide those being let go with medical and accident coverage until the end of the year, and counseling for mental, emotional, and financial stress throughout the same period.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is easily the hardest and longest deliberated decision the management team and I have been faced with over recent times. We have been fortunate to have some of the brightest missionary talent in the country join us over the last few years, and I would like to state unequivocally that this is not at all a reflection of anyone\u2019s performance,\u201d wrote Majety.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch, as well as Indian newspaper Economic Times and outlet Entrackr, reported in late April that the startup was<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/21\/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-is-cutting-jobs\/\"> cutting about 1,000 jobs<\/a>, mostly in the cloud kitchen category. Swiggy had confirmed the layoff at the time, but did not share a number.<\/p>\n<p>A Swiggy spokesperson did not immediately share whether today\u2019s announcement represents the same job cuts. A person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch today that Monday&#8217;s 1,100 job cuts primarily affect those in non-cloud kitchen parts of the business.<\/p>\n<p>Monday\u2019s announcement follows a similar move by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zomato\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zomato\">Zomato, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the No. 2 food delivery startup in India which said last week it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-cuts-13-of-workforce\/\">reducing its global workforce by 13%, or about 520 people<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Swiggy&#8217;s Majety said the company was &#8220;choosing to scale down or shut down\u00a0adjacent businesses that are either going to be highly volatile or will not be highly relevant for the next 18 months.&#8221; One of those businesses is cloud kitchens &#8212; an area Swiggy has focused on for more than two years, and seemingly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/19\/swiggy-cloud-kitchen-india\/\">doubled down just last quarter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Late last year, Swiggy executives said they had established 1,000 cloud kitchens for its restaurant partners in the country \u2014 more than any of its local rivals. The startup said it had invested in more than a million square feet of real estate space across 14 cities in the country in the last two years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Since the onset of Covid, we have already begun the process of shutting down our kitchen facilities temporarily or permanently, depending on their outlook and profitability profile. We are already operating at significantly lower levels on our staffing and physical infra than our earlier footprint, and will continue to optimize before we get more clarity on order volumes for food delivery,&#8221; wrote Majety.<\/p>\n<p>Swiggy and Zomato, that have formed duopoly in India&#8217;s food delivery business, are currently in talks to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/06\/indias-swiggy-raises-43m-to-expand-to-new-businesses\/\">raise additional capital<\/a> as part of their ongoing financing rounds. In recent weeks they have also started to deliver grocery items to spur demand.<\/p>\n<p>Several industries, especially travel and hospitality, have also been severely hit as people follow the New Delhi&#8217;s stay-at-home order. Oyo, a startup valued at $10 billion, said last month it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/08\/indias-oyo-furloughs-thousands-of-employees-as-revenue-drops-by-over-50\/\">placing thousands of employees on leave and furloughs for up to three months<\/a> in the U.S. and several other markets as its revenue dropped by more than 60% in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>Ixigo, a 13-year-old travel and hotel booking service, said late April it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/30\/ixigo-cuts-salary-of-every-employee-over-coronavirus\/\">cutting the salary of its entire staff.<\/a> MakeMyTrip, another travel and stay booking service, announced in the same month that it was also cutting the salary of its top management level across the company. This week, MakeMyTrip announced it was entering the food delivery business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swiggy said on Monday it is cutting 1,100 jobs and scaling down some adjacent businesses as India\u2019s top food delivery startup looks to reduce costs to survive the coronavirus pandemic that has made people cautious about ordering food online.

Bands and sells its own fitness tracking watches under the Amazfit brand in more than 70 countries. In a phone interview with TechCrunch, the firm said it is developing a see-through plastic mask with built-in ultraviolet lights that can disinfect filters within 10 minutes when connected to a power supply through a USB port. The caveat is that the lights only sanitize the inside of the mask and users still have to clean the outer surface themselves.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1989956\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1989956\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1989956\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AERI-Concept-X_11.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1989956\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Aeri concept comes with built-in ultraviolet lights that can disinfect filters within 10 minutes when connected to a power supply through a USB port.<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Called Aeri, the mask uses removable filters that are on par with N95 filtration capacity. If the concept materializes, each filter could last up to a month and a half, significantly longer than the average life of surgical masks and N95 respirators. The modular design allows for customized accessories such as a fan for breathable comfort, hence the mask&#8217;s name Aeri, a homophone of &#8220;airy&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Aeri started from the premise that wearing masks could thwart the increasingly common adoption of facial recognition. That said, imaging companies have been working on biometric upgrades to allow analyses of other facial features such as irises or the tip of noses.<\/p>\n<p>Aeri might still have a market appeal though, argued Pengtao Yu, vice president of industrial design at Huami. &#8220;Whether people need to unlock their phones or not, they want to see each other&#8217;s faces at social occasions,&#8221; said Yu, the California-based Chinese designer who had served clients including Nest Labs, Roku, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/gopro\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"gopro\">GoPro <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Huawei prior to joining Huami.<\/p>\n<p>Huami&#8217;s U.S. operation, which focuses on research and development, opened in 2014 and now counts a dozen of employees.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies turning to pandemic-fighting manufacturing have taken a hit from their core business, but Huami has managed to stay afloat. Its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/huami-corporation-reports-first-quarter-2020-unaudited-financial-results-301057438.html\">Q1<\/a> revenue was up 36% year-over-year to hit $154 million, although net income decreased to $2.7 million from $10.6 million. Its stocks have been declining, however, sliding from a high point of $16 in January to around $10 in mid-May.<\/p>\n<p>Huami is in the process of prototyping the Aeri masks. In Shenzhen, which houses the wearables company&#8217;s headquarters, the development cycle for hardware products &#8212; from ideation to market rollout &#8212; takes as short as 6-12 months thanks to the city&#8217;s rich supply chain resources, said Yu.<\/p>\n<p>Huami hasn&#8217;t priced Aeri at this early stage, but Yu admitted that the masks are targeting the &#8220;mass consumer market&#8221; around the world, not only for protection against viruses but also everyday air pollution, rather than appealing to medical workers. Given Huami&#8217;s history of making wearables at thin margins, it won&#8217;t be surprising that Aeri will be competitively priced.<\/p>\n<p>The Aeri project is part of Huami&#8217;s pivot to enter the general health sector beyond pure fitness monitoring. The company has recently teamed up with a laboratory led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, the public face of China&#8217;s fight against COVID-19, to track respiratory diseases using wearables. It&#8217;s also in talks with the German public health authority to collaborate on a smartwatch-powered virus monitoring app, the company told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a wave of Chinese companies with manufacturing operations to produce virus-fighting equipment: Shenzhen-based electric vehicle giant BYD quickly moved to launch what it claims to be the world&#8217;s largest mask plant; Hangzhou-based voice intelligence startup Rokid is making thermal imaging glasses\u00a0targeted at the US market; and many more.

Some kind of discussion &#8212; perhaps a dispute, perhaps just a friendly exchange of ideas &#8212; arises online. People regurgitate what they know, or what they think they know. A few admirable souls even include links to sources. Those people tend to be more correct &#8212;<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; unless their citation is a link to a video longer than a couple of minutes &#8230; in which case they are, almost invariably, completely wrong, and often far more wrong than even the wrongest of the people who cited nothing at all.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no intrinsic reason for this. Video is as good a medium as any for supporting a viewpoint. Longer videos should if anything provide better material support. So why are such online citations always, almost without exception, made of ridiculously brittle clay?<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Please note that I&#8217;m referring to discussions which involve some objective truth. De gustibus non est disputandum and all that, and videos are often one of the best ways to support subjective opinion. (&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Screen_Junkies#Honest_Trailers\">Honest Trailers<\/a>&#8221; might be my favorite YouTube series ever.) And a sixty-second clip to illustrate a particular concrete point? Often easily worth a thousand words.<\/p>\n<p>But when you&#8217;re linked to something ten minutes longer or more, especially with an exhortation to &#8220;watch the whole thing!&#8221;, you already know you&#8217;re entering the land of illogic and unreason.<\/p>\n<p>Is this because videos are a &#8220;hot&#8221; medium, connected straight(er) to our limbic system, and therefore unusually well suited to covering up half-truths and specious arguments? Are people instinctively more inclined to give the benefit of any doubt to an impassioned or confident person or voice, compared the benefit of the doubt, compared to the written word?<\/p>\n<p>Or is this a correlation-not-causation thing? Is someone who was willing to sit through a long video, almost by definition, someone who&#8217;s already internalized its arguments rather than think critically about them? And\/or, someone who favors information absorption via long videos because they have a relatively low level of written literacy, and therefore have limited critical thinking skills full stop?<\/p>\n<p>Or do people who link to long videos know that essentially no one has enough time and interest to actually wade their way through them? Are they just using their &#8220;citation&#8221; as a bad-faith smokescreen to pretend that they&#8217;re serious thinkers who have done their research? That strikes me as extremely plausible, a lot of the time. Some of the watch-this-half-hour-video people seem to be operating in good faith, though, just &#8230; misguided.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not an inherent law of the universe that if you have to cite a 30-minute video, it means you don&#8217;t actually have any cogent arguments. But it does seem to be a law of the Internet. Perhaps that&#8217;s for the best, though; it means when the deepfakes arrive en masse, we &#8212; or, at least, the critical thinkers among us &#8212; will be suspicious already.

Your relationship with shelter-in-place mandates and social distancing can look wildly different depending on your profession, age, health and, often, privilege. It\u2019s why a week of monotony for some of us might mean a week of madness for others. The best we can do, as exhaustion and Zoom fatigue sets in, is try to be patient, kind and thoughtful.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why this week we are showcasing a number of different tech initiatives trying to tackle the stresses of specific groups, from students to nurses. Let\u2019s get into it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Help for interns. <\/strong>Major League Hacking, an edtech company that focuses on engineers, is partnering with Github to launch a summer program that is an <a href=\"https:\/\/fellowship.mlh.io\/\">alternative to internships<\/a>. Students will spend 12 weeks working on open source projects, and get feedback from professional engineers. The students will be paid $1,000 per month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Healthcare worker family support. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/junilearning.com\/\">Juni Learning<\/a>, an online tutoring startup, launched a new initiative to support struggling families of healthcare workers. The platform is giving away $150,000 in credits for its Juni Team product. The Juni Team connects students to small groups with a live instructor to work on STEM projects. \u201cWe are hopeful that the Team Sessions will allow Juni to be able to support a greater number of students who may not necessarily need 1:1 instruction, but rather, just crave being back in a structured learning environment with new or existing friends,\u201d the CEO Vivian Shen said in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@vivianmshen\/doing-our-part-to-help-families-in-need-150k-in-free-tuition-812a7bc8db57\">a Medium post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health-friendly snorkels. <\/strong>Doctors at hospitals all around the country teamed up to work with Google project engineers and academics from Columbia, MIT, Harvard and more to make snorkel masks into protective PPE gear for doctors. The masks are not meant to replace FDA-approved N95s, but instead can take the place of disposable N95s. Researchers took snorkels, printed breathing filters using 3-D technology and are giving the washable and <a href=\"https:\/\/maskson.org\/\">reusable product to healthcare workers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A free social media manager. <\/strong>Unemployment in 2020 is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/unemployment-rate-could-hit-25-percent-goldman-sachs-predicts\/\"> rivaling the Great Depression<\/a>, leaving over 30 million Americans without work. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http:\/\/justloop.it\/\">SalesLoop<\/a> is giving its platform, which manages social media platforms on LinkedIn, Twitter, and e-mail, for free to job seekers for three months. \u201cThe aim here is to help people who want to grow their network and be proactive about reaching out to potential hiring managers, to do so for free. Normally, our biggest customer base are recruiters \u2013 so this is sort of the reverse effect that we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d said John Fennessy, a director at the company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On-demand volunteers. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.monami.io\/\">Mon Ami<\/a> is collaborating with the city of San Francisco and Los Angeles to connect thousands of available volunteers free to do critical errands with people in need, from seniors living alone to at-risk adults and children. The volunteer management platform is backed by Cowboy Ventures, and traditionally connected college students with the elderly. During COVID-19, Mon Ami has set up volunteers one-on-one with people in need, and serves as a central hub to help cities, NGOs target more seamlessly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Firefly tries to help.\u00a0<\/strong>Ridesharing advertising company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fireflyon.com\/\">Firefly<\/a> is providing an in-car plastic protective sheet-film to its drivers at no cost to help reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. The initiative is starting in San Francisco and is aimed to help independent rideshare drivers that drive for a ride-hailing company like Uber or Lyft.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sound on.\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shure.com\/en-US\">Shure<\/a>, a Chicago-based headphone startup, has donated $79,000 worth of earphones to Chicago Public Schools to support students and teachers with online learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thank you notes for healthcare workers. <\/strong>Depending on where you live, when 7 p.m. rolls around your street might be filled with cheers in solitude with your local healthcare workers. But, for those workers on shift, the cheers might be muffled from the sheer stress happening within hospitals. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.6ftcloser.com\/\">6FTCloser<\/a> lets anybody send a quick, personalized video at no cost to frontline workers, for them to watch on their time. The platform was founded mid-April and over 1,000 frontline workers in 40 states across America and more than nine countries have received personalized videos thanks to this service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Headspace for a year. <\/strong>Unemployed Americans are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/unemployed-americans-can-get-a-free-year-of-headspace\/\">eligible for a year of Headspace<\/a>, a digital meditation service. The mobile app startup also offered its meditation content to any and all frontline workers. \u201cWhile meditation and mindfulness can\u2019t change our circumstances in life, it can help us change our perspective on those circumstances. And, now more than ever, that\u2019s an incredibly powerful skill to learn,\u201d said Rich Pierson, the CEO of Headspace, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200514005286\/en\/Headspace-Announces-Free-One-Year-Subscriptions-Unemployed-Americans\">in a release.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Honorable mention. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/15\/where-to-shop-online-that-isnt-amazon-target-or-walmart\/\">Where to shop that isn\u2019t Amazon, Target or Walmart?<\/a>\u00a0A few of us on the TechCrunch team listed out a couple options to support local businesses versus big corporations.

At times, I\u2019m overwhelmed by the images of countless patients on life-support and the near-endless streams of statistics regurgitating bad news.<\/p>\n<p>Having started in venture at the beginning of two recessions, I\u2019ve seen how the startup industry functions during economic trouble. My second day of work at Charles River Ventures was September 11th, 2001. My first project, analyzing the VC industry, propelled the firm to return more than 60% of its fund to investors, going from a $1.2 billion fund to $450 million. In May 2008, Mike Maples and I founded Floodgate in the midst of the Great Recession. We learned that great founders won\u2019t wait for a better economic moment to start a company.<\/p>\n<p>While we are currently embroiled in personal and professional circumstances unimaginable even three months ago, these very challenges will form the basis of incredibly innovative ideas. In order for the world to move forward, we need our greatest minds to imagine a brighter future and create solutions to make it a reality.<\/p>\n<p>When I analyze our society and novel health situation, one thing is certain: COVID-19 is a paradigm-shifting event, creating massively accelerated social and economic change.<\/p>\n<h2>The Great Reset is not just another economic event<\/h2>\n<p>Our current situation is unique. It\u2019s not merely a cyclical economic event, nor is it a standalone health crisis. What we are experiencing is not just an inflection point: it\u2019s a societal phase-change unlike anything we have ever seen. We face an epic choice of how we move forward, and the decisions we make today will shape an entire generation.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why: COVID-19 is prompting us to reset many of our most fundamental behaviors. These changes are impacting our financial system, with effects visible throughout our homes, businesses and even the concept of \u201cworkplace\u201d itself.<\/p>\n<h2>COVID-19 is pervasive<\/h2>\n<p>As a global pandemic, the virus itself has spread to nearly every country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Between February 20 and March 26, 100% of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies implemented government-mandated social distancing. Globally, the number of scheduled airline flights is down 64%. In some countries, like Spain and Germany, flight numbers are down by more than 90%.<\/p>\n<p>Since the timeline for lifting government restrictions is unclear \u2014 and even then, scientists are uncertain how the virus will spread \u2014 the question lingers: How long will this go on?<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19\u2019s impact is uncertain, long-term and potentially undulating, affecting every facet of our lives. You can\u2019t simply wait it out with the expectation that industries will rebound. In 2001, September 11 felt pervasive, but its economic impact ultimately stemmed from just one single incident and the resulting fear&#8230; and that one single incident still cost more than three trillion dollars. How much larger will COVID-19 be?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re entering a new paradigm, and that brings possibilities.
